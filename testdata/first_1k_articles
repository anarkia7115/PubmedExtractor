27918336|a|<AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Anesthesiology residency primarily emphasizes the development of medical knowledge and technical skills. Yet, nontechnical skills (NTS) are also vital to successful clinical practice. Elements of NTS are communication, teamwork, situational awareness, and decision making. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The first 10 consecutive senior residents who chose to participate in this 2-week elective rotation of operating room (OR) management and leadership training were enrolled in this study, which spanned from March 2013 to March 2015. Each resident served as the anesthesiology officer of the day (AOD) and was tasked with coordinating OR assignments, managing care for 2 to 4 ORs, and being on call for the trauma OR; all residents were supervised by an attending AOD. Leadership and NTS techniques were taught via a standardized curriculum consisting of leadership and team training articles, crisis management text, and daily debriefings. Resident self-ratings and attending AOD and charge nurse raters used the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) scoring system, which involved task management, situational awareness, teamwork, and decision making. For each of the 10 residents in their third year of clinical anesthesiology training (CA-3) who participated in this elective rotation, there were 14 items that required feedback from resident self-assessment and OR raters, including the daily attending AOD and charge nurse. Results for each of the items on the questionnaire were compared between the beginning and the end of the rotation with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched samples. Comparisons were run separately for attending AOD and charge nurse assessments and resident self-assessments. Scaled rankings were analyzed for the Kendall coefficient of concordance (?) for rater agreement with associated ? and P value. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Common themes identified by the residents during debriefings were recurrence of challenging situations and the skills residents needed to instruct and manage clinical teams. For attending AOD and charge nurse assessments, resident performance of NTS improved from the beginning to the end of the rotation on 12 of the 14 NTS items (P < .05), whereas resident self-assessment improved on 3 NTS items (P < .05). Interrater reliability (across the charge nurse, resident, and AOD raters) ranged from ? = .36 to .61 at the beginning of the rotation and ? = .27 to .70 at the end of the rotation. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This rotation allowed for teaching and resident assessment to occur in a way that facilitated resident education in several of the skills required to meet specific milestones. Resident physicians are able to foster NTS and build a framework for clinical leadership when completing a 2-week senior elective as an OR manager. </AbstractText>

It differs significantly from the alternative subdural grid approach, in both conceptualization of partial epilepsy-as a 3-D distributed network, rather than as focal pathology with contiguous spread-and by the method of sampling used-which is sparse and directed rather than continuous over adjacent brain areas.

Subsequently, the Talairach methodology was adopted at a number of additional centers in Europe and Canada. Technical aspects remained essentially unchanged for the following 30 years. Only in the last two decades, because of advancements in image-guided surgery systems, robotics, and computer-aided planning, use of SEEG has become more widespread, and reports describing these new developments have been published. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This systematic review was designed to assess published reports of SEEG surgical techniques and safety profile. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DATA SOURCES" NlmCategory="METHODS">An electronic search was performed of Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases.

27918345|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Intracranial EEG has been in use for more than 50 years in the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy. The stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method has expanded very significantly over the last 5 years, in parallel with the increase in the number of complex cases (i.e., MRI-negative) being referred with medically intractable focal epilepsy to major epilepsy surgery centers. Some centers with extensive experience in subdural electrodes are indeed changing or have changed to SEEG as the principal exploration technique, which suggests that SEEG might offer specific benefits through its approach to accurately localizing the epileptogenic zone. However, interpretation of SEEG, which is a key step to its usefulness, may vary from one center to another. This may be due to different conceptual bases and the available expertise in each center. This heterogeneity in use of SEEG should be taken into account as it could contribute to erroneous conclusions and thus unfavorable outcome of epilepsy surgery. At present, there is a lack of guidelines for optimal SEEG use, although development of these is in progress. It remains challenging to translate SEEG interpretation into a practical approach to delineating surgical strategy. Identification of clear biomarkers will help in the definition of the epileptogenic zone and subsequent cortical resection. In addition, SEEG seems to be a unique tool for the in vivo investigation of human cerebral networks distributed over several lobes or sublobar structures, allowing a better understanding of their functioning. </AbstractText>

27918346|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">The challenge in epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic zone without compromising postoperative function. Electrical stimulation (ES) was developed to identify with greater anatomical and physiological precision cortical structures essential to language and motor function. Because the language network is widely distributed in the left (dominant) hemisphere, and often varies among patients, brain mapping should delineate eloquent areas at the individual level. Although ES for language is commonly performed during a presurgical investigation, the procedure remains nonstandardized among centers, and differences between grids and intracerebral depth electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography) should be taken into account when comparing results from different series. Electrical simulation exerts a complex summation effect in a given volume of brain tissue; the net result may be difficult to predict because this depends on methodological and physiological factors as follows: stimulation parameters, type of electrodes used, tasks used, presence or not of an after-discharge. We discuss in the present article some methodological aspects of the stimulation procedure influencing functional mapping because it pertains in particular to language mapping. In stereoelectroencephalography, the other goal of ES is to trigger seizures. Because seizures develop in neural networks that are imperfectly sampled by intracerebral electrodes, spontaneous seizure recording is not always sufficient to properly localize the epileptogenic zone. The rationale for performing ES is based on the electrophysiological distinction between local/regional after-discharge and seizure networks. A different response to ES-induced seizures can be seen for supra- and infra-sylvian epilepsies. The procedures for triggering seizures and for functional mapping should be performed in conjunction to answer the fundamental question whether or not there is a spatio-temporal overlap between the epileptogenic and the functional network. The exploration of both networks through stimulation exemplifies the importance of anatomo-electro-clinical correlations in stereoelectroencephalography. </AbstractText>

After transplantation, she presented with a painful whitish ulcerative lesion accompanied by central necrosis in the right soft palate area measuring about 3 cm×3.5 cm. Histopathologic evaluation of the lesion showed monomorphic B-cell-type PTLD. She received 6 courses of CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab. In the follow-up, the lesion disappeared with scar formation. Therefore, PTLD has different clinical presentations and may involve any part of the body. Therefore, when an unusual oral lesion after solid organ transplantation is observed, PTLD should be considered in addition to other differential diagnoses. </AbstractText>

We examined influence of age, sex, race/ethnicity, payer, income, distance, tumor type, and complications on utilization of PCSCs and LOS (SAS 9.2). Analysis of 24,559 pediatric oncology febrile neutropenia discharges showed hospitalizations in PCSCs increasing from 48% in 1983 to 94% in 2011. The adjusted regression analysis showed decreased PCSC utilization for ages 15 to 18, Hispanic patients, and those living >40 miles away.

Six (1.98%) had tip fold-over with 5/6 right-sided ears. Tip fold-over occurred predominantly at 270 degrees and was associated with precurved electrodes (5/6). Patients did not report audiological complaints during initial activation. In one patient, the electrode array remained within the scala tympani with preserved residual hearing despite the fold-over. Spread of excitation supported tip fold-over, but the predictive value was not clear. EFI predicted location of the fold-over with clear predictive value in one patient. At an average follow-up of 11 months, three subjects underwent deactivation of the overlapping electrodes with two of them showing marked audiological improvement. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In a large academic center with experienced surgeons, tip fold-over occurred at a rate of 1.98% but was not immediately identifiable clinically. CT imaging definitively showed tip fold-over. Deactivating involved electrodes may improve performance possibly avoiding revision surgery. EFI may be highly predictive of tip fold-over and can be run intraoperatively, potentially obviating the need for intraop fluoroscopy. </AbstractText>

27918369|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Despite significant advances in antibiotic therapy and intensive care, sepsis remains the most common cause of death in intensive care units. We previously reported that molecular hydrogen (H2) acts as a therapeutic and preventive antioxidant. Here, we show that preadministration of H2-dissolved water (HW) suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxin shock in mice. Drinking HW for 3 days before LPS injection prolonged survival in a mouse model of sepsis. The H2 concentration immediately increased in the liver but not in the kidney after drinking HW. The protective effects of the preadministration of HW on LPS-induced liver injury were examined. Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, preadministration of HW reduced the increase in both apoptosis and oxidative stress. Moreover, preadministration of HW enhanced LPS-induced expression of heme oxyganase-1 and reduced endothelin-1 expression. These results indicate the therapeutic potential of HW in preventing acute injury of the liver with attenuation of an increase in oxidative stress. HW is likely to trigger adaptive responses against oxidative stress. </AbstractText>

Enteral nutrition, organ dysfunction, local and systemic infection, number of re-explorations, worsening ISS and the development of a fistula appeared to significantly delay DFC. Age and APACHE II score were predictors for in-hospital mortality. Failed DFC, large bowel resection and > 5-10 litres of intravenous fluids in < 48 hours were predictors of entero-atmospheric fistula. The source of infection (small bowel as opposed to colon) was a predictor for ventral hernia. Large bowel resection, > 5-10 and > 10 litres of intravenous fluids in < 48 hours were predictors of intra-abdominal abscess.

Every aspect of care delivery is being scrutinized, yet the constant requirement remains assurance of high-quality, highly reliable care that is cost-effective and easily accessible. The nursing workforce remains visible in traditional roles as well as in new and innovative capacities, whereas nurse executives experience expanded realms of focus and responsibility. As health systems continue to adapt to the changing environment, the ability to leverage the role and scope of the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) as a health care provider is emerging as an essential business and care strategy. While the APRN role is more commonly accepted in primary care, ambiguity persists in how to best use the role along the continuum of care to achieve the cost-effective solutions required in today's health care environment. Successful health care systems of today and tomorrow are those that act boldly in a strategic direction. Data-driven decision making is key to meaningful change, whether clinical or operational. The need to develop high-functioning, integrated provider teams is apparent and immediate. Nurse executives and their nursing leadership colleagues must lead with evidence in hand to create infrastructures that support true integration, optimization, and engagement of all members of the provider team to better serve our patients and communities. </AbstractText>

Given the imminent retirement of baby boomer physicians, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the increased utilization of health care services by an ever-aging population, the supply of providers cannot keep pace with the demand for services. This has led to an increased utilization of advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs). This article shows how one large highly-matrixed health care system approached identifying this workforce, and how thought leaders worked collaboratively with physicians, administrators, and ACPs to meet a growing demand for providers. Carolinas HealthCare System developed a 3-pronged approach to this opportunity. The development of a Center for Advanced Practice was explored and implemented. This Center serves as a 2-way conduit of information and ideas between system administrators and providers. It also serves as a central source of regulatory and practice information for administrators and providers. The growing number of open ACP positions, along with the reluctance to employ novice and new graduate ACPs, led to the development of a postgraduate transition to practice fellowship program. This program's clinical tracks and curriculum are described. Finally, a collaborative effort between the health care system and a local university resulted in the local offering of an acute care nurse practitioner program, which allowed system nurses to continue their education without the need for relocation. Higher satisfaction and engagement, lower turnover, better career opportunities, more satisfied administrators, and physicians all contributed to the overwhelming success of this initiative. </AbstractText>

In addition, the opportunity for nurse-owned or nurse-led practices has never been greater. However, many APNs currently work in a structured environment where the employer focuses on the business aspects of the practice and the APN focuses primarily on clinical care. Often APNs are unaware of the entrepreneurial contribution they make to the practice. A Needs Assessment Survey was developed to better understand business and practice management knowledge and skills of APNs in New Jersey. The survey included 14 categories for competency development. Twelve of the 14 categories showed that APNs were at a novice or an advanced beginner level. APNs need to demonstrate their value and take a lead to help solve primary care access issues. This can only be accomplished if APNs are willing to seize the opportunity and overcome barriers and knowledge gaps through both formal and informal education to step out of their traditional positions into more independent roles. </AbstractText>

This is a cross-sectional survey study of 336 CRNAs randomly selected from American Association of Nurse Anesthetists database. Workload was measured using NASA Task-Load Index and the Revised Individual Workload Perception Scale. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Overall Perceptions of Safety Scale and Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Patient Safety Grade Scale were utilized to measure safety culture. Dependent variables (ARE) included difficult intubation/extubation, inadequate ventilation/oxygenation, and pulmonary aspiration. The Revised Individual Workload Perception Scale workload was significantly associated with ARE. Years' experience and Patient Safety Grade Scale were inversely associated with ARE. Overall Perceptions of Safety Scale was significantly and inversely associated with ARE. Practice model, education, and work setting were not associated with ARE. Based on findings, CRNA workload, years' experience, and patient safety culture may be important markers for ARE.

On the basis of current utilization patterns, demand for primary care providers is expected to grow more rapidly than physician supply. This imbalance is expected to worsen, as the aging population requires more health care resources. In addition, more patients are requiring critical care services and physician numbers are not keeping with this growing need. Restrictions on resident physician practice hours have impacted inpatient care as well. Revisiting outdated state practice laws, and considering Full Practice Authority (FPA) for nurse practitioners (NP), is needed for improving access to care while creating greater flexibility for development of patient-centered health care homes and other emerging models of care delivery. Currently, 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted FPA for NPs, with 15 more states planning legislation in 2016. Allowing FPA and Prescriptive Authority (PA) enables NPs to become more efficient and effective patient care team members.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM639 can decrease Al burden in the tissues of mice by inhibiting intestinal Al absorption. The main aim of the present research was to investigate whether the protection by the strain is also associated with enhancement of the intestinal barrier, alleviation of oxidative stress and modulation of the inflammatory response. In an in vitro cell model, two protection modes (intervention and therapy) were examined and the results indicated that L. plantarum CCFM639 alleviated Al-induced cytotoxicity. In a mouse model, L. plantarum CCFM639 treatment was found to significantly alleviate oxidative stress in the intestinal tract, regulate the function of the intestinal mucosal immune system, restore the integrity of tight junction proteins and maintain intestinal permeability. These results suggest that in addition to Al sequestration, L. plantarum CCFM639 can also inhibit Al absorption by protecting the intestinal barrier, alleviating Al-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Therefore, L. plantarum CCFM639 has the potential to be a dietary supplement ingredient that provides protection against Al-induced gut injury. </AbstractText>

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether self-induced variations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be useful as control signals for an upper-limb exoskeleton developed by us. A BMI based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) is proposed. In the decoder-training phase, we investigate the offline classification performance of left versus right hand and left hand versus both feet by using motor execution (ME) or motor imagery (MI). The results indicate that the accuracies of ME sessions are higher than those of MI sessions, and left hand versus both feet paradigm achieves a better classification performance, which would be used in the online-control phase. In the online-control phase, the trained decoder is tested in two scenarios (wearing or without wearing the exoskeleton). The MI and ME sessions wearing the exoskeleton achieve mean classification accuracy of 84.29% ± 2.11% and 87.37% ± 3.06%, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the proposed BMI is effective to control the upper-limb exoskeleton, and provides a practical method by non-invasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior for clinical applications. </AbstractText>

Existing works in this field mainly focus on recognizing activities by using traditional features extracted from Fourier transform (FT) or wavelet transform (WT). However, these signal processing approaches are suitable for a linear signal but not for a nonlinear signal. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for dealing with activity data with properties such as nonlinearity and non-stationarity. A multi-features extraction method based on HHT is then proposed to improve the effect of activity recognition. The extracted multi-features include instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF) by means of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), as well as instantaneous energy density (IE) and marginal spectrum (MS) derived from Hilbert spectral analysis. Experimental studies are performed to verify the proposed approach by using the PAMAP2 dataset from the University of California, Irvine for wearable sensors-based activity recognition. Moreover, the effect of combining multi-features vs. a single-feature are investigated and discussed in the scenario of a dependent subject. The experimental results show that multi-features combination can further improve the performance measures. Finally, we test the effect of multi-features combination in the scenario of an independent subject. Our experimental results show that we achieve four performance indexes: recall, precision, F-measure, and accuracy to 0.9337, 0.9417, 0.9353, and 0.9377 respectively, which are all better than the achievements of related works. </AbstractText>

Many current applications use active touch sensing technologies. Passive touch sensing technologies are, however, more adequate to implement low power or energy harvesting touch sensing interfaces. This paper presents a passive touch sensing technique based on the fact that the human body is affected by the surrounding extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields, such as those of AC power lines. These external ELF fields induce electric potentials on the human body-because human tissues exhibit some conductivity at these frequencies-resulting in what is called AC hum. We therefore propose a passive touch sensing system that detects this hum noise when a human touch occurs, thus distinguishing between touch and non-touch events. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by designing and implementing a flexible touch sensing keyboard. </AbstractText>

Small larvae were more susceptible to nitric oxide than other stages at 0.5% NO concentration. There were no significant differences among life stages at 1.0% to 2.0% NO concentrations. In 24 h treatments of eggs, 3.0% NO fumigation at 2 °C achieved 100% egg mortality. Two 24 h fumigation treatments of infested apples containing medium and large larvae with 3.0% and 5.0% NO resulted in 98% and 100% mortalities respectively. Sound apples were also fumigated with 5.0% NO for 24 h at 2 °C to determine effects on apple quality. The fumigation treatment was terminated by flushing with nitrogen and had no negative impact on postharvest quality of apples as measured by firmness and color at 2 and 4 weeks after fumigation. This study demonstrated that NO fumigation was effective against codling moth and safe to apple quality, and therefore has potential to become a practical alternative to methyl bromide fumigation for control of codling moth in apples. </AbstractText>

At present, it is considered to be a serious threat in various countries in Europe, North Africa, and Middle East. The extensive use and the developed resistance of T. absoluta to spinosad causes some concern, which leads to the need for alternative products. (2) Materials and Methods: Several laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the ovicidal properties of a zeolite particle film on T. absoluta. The toxicity of three different zeolites and six zeolite formulations to T. absoluta eggs and larvae was determined using different exposure methods. (3) Results: In general, the formulated zeolites yielded higher egg and larvae mortality values, especially when the zeolite particle film was residually applied. Notable differences in mortality rates from exposure to zeolites compared to other products, such as kaolin, its formulated product Surround, and the insecticide spinosad, were observed. Kaolin and Surround exhibited little or no effect for both application methods, while the hatch rate was reduced by 95% when spinosad was applied topically. Spinosad yielded egg and larvae mortality rates of 100% for both application methods. Additionally, increased oviposition activity was observed in adults exposed to the wettable powder (WP) formulations. These WP formulations increased egg deposition, while Surround and spinosad elicited a negative oviposition response. (4) Conclusions: It can be derived that the tested products, zeolites BEA (Beta polymorph A), FAU (Faujasite), LTA (Linde type A), and their formulations, had no real insecticidal activity against the eggs of T. absoluta. Nevertheless, egg exposure to zeolites seemed to affect the development process by weakening the first instar larvae and increasing their mortality. Subsequently, based on the choice test, no significant difference was observed between the number of eggs laid on the treated leaves and control leaves. </AbstractText>

Love mode propagation was modeled by numerically solving the system of coupled electro-mechanical field equations and Navier-Stokes equations. The phase and group velocities and the attenuation of the acoustic wave propagating along the 30° tilted c-axis ZnO/glass structure contacting a viscous non-conductive liquid were calculated for different ZnO guiding layer thicknesses, added mass thicknesses, and liquid viscosity and density. The three sensor responses, i.e., the wave phase and group velocity, and attenuation changes are calculated for different environmental parameters and related to the sensor velocity and attenuation sensitivities. The resulted sensitivities to liquid viscosity and added mass were optimized by adjusting the ZnO guiding layer thickness corresponding to a sensitivity peak. The present analysis is valuable for the manufacture and application of the ZnO-glass structure Love wave sensors for the detection of liquid properties, such as viscosity, density and mass anchored to the sensor surface. </AbstractText>

Elevated level of brain ammonia has been strongly implicated in the development of astrocyte swelling associated with ALF. The means by which ammonia brings about astrocyte swelling, however, is incompletely understood. Recently, oxidative/nitrosative stress and associated signaling events, including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), as well as activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-?B), have been implicated in the mechanism of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Since these signaling events are known to be regulated by the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), we examined the state of STAT3 activation in ammonia-treated cultured astrocytes, and determined whether altered STAT3 activation and/or protein expression contribute to the ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. STAT3 was found to be dephosphorylated (inactivated) at Tyrosine705 in ammonia-treated cultured astrocytes. Total STAT3 protein level was also reduced in ammonia-treated astrocytes. We also found a significant increase in protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type-1 (PTPRT-1) protein expression in ammonia-treated cultured astrocytes, and that inhibition of PTPRT-1 enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT3 after ammonia treatment. Additionally, exposure of cultured astrocytes to inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases diminished the ammonia-induced cell swelling, while cultured astrocytes over-expressing STAT3 showed a reduction in the astrocyte swelling induced by ammonia. Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that inactivation of STAT3 represents a critical event in the mechanism of the astrocyte swelling associated with acute liver failure. </AbstractText>

However, the measured acceleration is inevitably polluted by severe noise. Therefore, a proper noise suppression procedure is required. This paper presents a novel method to reduce the noise in the measured vertical acceleration for a thrust-vectored tail-sitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV. In the new procedure, a Kalman filter is first applied to estimate the UAV mass by using the information in the vertical thrust and measured acceleration. The UAV mass is then used to compute an estimate of UAV vertical acceleration. The estimated acceleration is finally fused with the measured acceleration to obtain the minimum variance estimate of vertical acceleration. By doing this, the new approach incorporates the thrust information into the acceleration estimate. The method is applied to the data measured in a VTOL UAV takeoff experiment. Two other denoising approaches developed by former researchers are also tested for comparison. The results demonstrate that the new method is able to suppress the acceleration noise substantially. It also maintains the real-time performance in the final estimated acceleration, which is not seen in the former denoising approaches. The acceleration treated with the new method can be readily used in the motion control applications for UAVs to achieve improved accuracy. </AbstractText>

For energy efficiency, a novel radio frequency (RF) energy-harvesting scheme is presented in which each IoT device is associated with the best possible RF source in order to maximize the overall energy that the IoT devices harvest. For energy balancing, the IoT devices in close proximity are clustered together and then an IoT device with the highest residual energy is selected as a cluster head (CH) on a rotational basis. Once the CH is selected, it assigns channels to the IoT devices to report their data using a novel integer linear program (ILP)-based channel allocation scheme by satisfying their desired QoS. To evaluate the presented schemes, exhaustive simulations are carried out by varying different parameters, including the number of IoT devices, the number of harvesting sources, the distance between RF sources and IoT devices and the primary user (PU) activity of different channels.

Identification of health-related behavioral risk factors including diet quality and physical and sedentary activities for ADHD is important for prioritizing behavioral intervention strategies to improve mental health. This study aimed to examine the association of diet quality, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours in childhood with ADHD throughout adolescence. We linked data from grade five students aged primarily 10 and 11 years old who participated in a population-based lifestyle survey in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia with their administrative health care data. We applied negative binomial regression methods to examine the associations between health behaviours and ADHD. Of the 4875 students, 9.7% had one or more diagnoses of ADHD between the ages of 10/11 and 18 years. The number of primary diagnoses with ADHD was statistically significantly lower among students with better diet quality, higher levels of physical activity, and those that spent less time playing computers and video games (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that health promotion programs aiming to improve children's diets and active lifestyles may also reduce the public health burden of ADHD. </AbstractText>

A potential negative consequence of this positivity bias is the increased consumption of unhealthy foods. This study investigated whether a positivity bias would occur in unhealthy variations of four products (cookies, corn flakes, pizzas and yoghurts) that featured different health claim conditions (no claim, nutrient claim, general level health claim, and higher level health claim) and FoPL conditions (no FoPL, the Daily Intake Guide (DIG), Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), and the Health Star Rating (HSR)). Positivity bias was assessed via measures of perceived healthiness, global evaluations (incorporating taste, quality, convenience, etc.) and willingness to buy. On the whole, health claims did not produce a positivity bias, while FoPLs did, with the DIG being the most likely to elicit this bias. The HSR most frequently led to lower ratings of unhealthy foods than the DIG and MTL, suggesting that this FoPL has the lowest risk of creating an inaccurate positivity bias in unhealthy foods. </AbstractText>

Even if prolactin (PRL) does not belong to the sex hormones family, its crucial role in female reproduction and lactation has prompted great efforts to understand if PRL could represent a gender factor in the pathogenesis of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for this disease. Extensive literature has documented a remarkable immune-stimulating potential for this hormone, indicating PRL as a disease-promoting factor in MS and EAE. However, recent work has pointed out that PRL is endowed with important neuroprotective and remyelinating properties and has encouraged a reinterpretation of the involvement of this hormone in MS. In this review we summarize both the protective functions that PRL exerts in central nervous system tissue as well as the inflammatory activity of this hormone in the context of autoimmune responses against myelin. Last, we draw future lines of research that might help to better clarify the impact of PRL on MS pathology. </AbstractText>

Although estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) are the mainstay therapeutic targets in breast cancer, the androgen receptor (AR) is evolving as a molecular target for cancers that have developed resistance to conventional treatments. The high expression of AR in breast cancer and recent discovery and development of new nonsteroidal drugs targeting the AR provide a strong rationale for exploring it again as a therapeutic target in this disease. Ironically, both nonsteroidal agonists and antagonists for the AR are undergoing clinical trials, making AR a complicated target to understand in breast cancer. This review provides a detailed account of AR's therapeutic role in breast cancer. </AbstractText>

It was proposed that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in body fluids could potentially indicate infection. However, the connection between herpes zoster and circulating miRNAs has not been demonstrated. In this study, 41 HZ patients without superinfection were selected. The serum miRNA levels were analyzed by TaqMan low density array (TLDA) and confirmed individually by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. Thirty-five age-matched subjects without any infectious diseases or inflammation were selected as controls. The results showed that the serum miRNA expression profiles in 41 HZ patients were different from those of control subjects. Specifically, 18 miRNAs were up-regulated and 126 were down-regulated more than two-fold in HZ patients compared with controls. The subsequent confirmation of these results by qRT-PCR, as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, revealed that six kinds of miRNAs, including miR-190b, miR-571, miR-1276, miR-1303, miR-943, and miR-661, exhibited statistically significant enhanced expression levels (more than four-fold) in HZ patients, compared with those of healthy controls and herpes simplex virus (HSV) patients. Subsequently, it is proposed that these circulating miRNAs are capable of regulating numerous pathways and some may even participate in the inflammatory response or nervous system activity. This study has initially demonstrated that the serum miRNA expression profiles in HZ patients were different from those of uninfected individuals. Additionally, these findings also suggest that six of the altered miRNA could be potentially used as biomarkers to test for latent HZ infection. </AbstractText>

PP1 is also targeted to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by NIPP1 where it can dephosphorylate RNAPII and cycle-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). Here, we show that treatment of cells with a small molecule activator of PP1 increases the abundance of a neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)-derived peptide. NRG-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in the cells stably or transiently expressing mutant NIPP1 (mNIPP1) that does not bind PP1, but not in the cells expressing NIPP1. Expression of mNIPP1 also activated the NRG-1 promoter in an NF-?B-dependent manner. Analysis of extracts from mNIPP1 expressing cells by glycerol gradient centrifugation showed a redistribution of PP1 and CDK9 between large and small molecular weight complexes, and increased CDK9 Thr-186 phosphorylation. This correlated with the increased CDK9 activity. Further, RNAPII co-precipitated with mNIPP1, and phosphorylation of RNAPII C-terminal domain (CTD) Ser-2 residues was greater in cells expressing mNIPP1. In mNIPP1 expressing cells, okadaic acid, a cell-permeable inhibitor of PP1, did not increase Ser-2 CTD phosphorylation inhibited by flavopiridol, in contrast to the NIPP1 expressing cells, suggesting that PP1 was no longer involved in RNAPII dephosphorylation. Finally, media conditioned with mNIPP1 cells induced the proliferation of wild type 84-31 cells, consistent with a role of neuregulin-1 as a growth promoting factor. Our study indicates that deregulation of PP1/NIPP1 holoenzyme activates NRG-1 expression through RNAPII and CDK9 phosphorylation in a NF-?B dependent manner. </AbstractText>

The findings are used to develop readily applicable mathematical models to predict solvent fluxes and solute rejections through solvent resistant membranes used for nanofiltration. The new model was developed based on a pore-flow type of transport. New parameters found to be of fundamental importance were introduced to the equation, i.e., the affinity of the solute and the solvent for the membrane expressed as the hydrogen-bonding contribution of the solubility parameter for the solute, solvent and membrane. A graphical map was constructed to predict the solute rejection based on the hydrogen-bonding contribution of the solubility parameter. The model was evaluated with performance data from the literature. Both the solvent flux and the solute rejection calculated with the new approach were similar to values reported in the literature. </AbstractText>

Its co-evolutionary interactions with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase protein enzymes define the specificities of the genetic code and those with the ribosome their accurate biosynthetic interpretation. Phylogenetic approaches that focus on molecular structure allow reconstruction of evolutionary timelines that describe the history of RNA and protein structural domains. Here we review phylogenomic analyses that reconstruct the early history of the synthetase enzymes and the ribosome, their interactions with RNA, and the inception of amino acid charging and codon specificities in tRNA that are responsible for the genetic code. We also trace the age of domains and tRNA onto ancient tRNA homologies that were recently identified in rRNA. Our findings reveal a timeline of recruitment of tRNA building blocks for the formation of a functional ribosome, which holds both the biocatalytic functions of protein biosynthesis and the ability to store genetic memory in primordial RNA genomic templates. </AbstractText>

This study was designed to characterize the chemical constituents of B. x buttiana extracts with antioxidant and cytotoxic activities using different solvents. The extraction solvents used were as follows: distilled water (dH?O), methanol (MeOH), acetone (DMK), ethanol (EtOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane (DCM), and hexane (Hex) (100%) at an extraction temperature of 26 °C. Analysis of bioactive compounds present in the B. x buttiana extracts included the application of common phytochemical screening assays, GC-MS analysis, and cytotoxicity and antioxidant assays. The results show that the highest extraction yield was observed with water and methanol. The maximum total phenolic content amount and highest antioxidant potential were obtained when extraction with methanol was used. With the exceptions of water and ethanol extractions, all other extracts showed cytotoxicity ranging between 31% and 50%. The prevailing compounds in water, methanol, ethanol, and acetone solvents were as follows: 4H-pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3, 5-dihydroxy-6-methyl (2), 2-propenoic acid, 3-(2-hydrophenyl)-(E)- (3), and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (6).

In a WMN, wireless routers provide multi-hop wireless connectivity between hosts in the network and also allow them to access the Internet via gateway devices. Wireless routers are typically equipped with multiple radios operating on different channels to increase network throughput. Multicast is a form of communication that delivers data from a source to a set of destinations simultaneously. It is used in a number of applications, such as distributed games, distance education, and video conferencing. In this study, we address a channel assignment problem for multicast in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs. In a multi-radio multi-channel WMN, two nearby nodes will interfere with each other and cause a throughput decrease when they transmit on the same channel. Thus, an important goal for multicast channel assignment is to reduce the interference among networked devices. We have developed a minimum interference channel assignment (MICA) algorithm for multicast that accurately models the interference relationship between pairs of multicast tree nodes using the concept of the interference factor and assigns channels to tree nodes to minimize interference within the multicast tree. Simulation results show that MICA achieves higher throughput and lower end-to-end packet delay compared with an existing channel assignment algorithm named multi-channel multicast (MCM). In addition, MICA achieves much lower throughput variation among the destination nodes than MCM. </AbstractText>

They are implicated in multiple and essential physiological functions. In humans they play an important role as microconstituents of the daily diet, their consumption being considered healthy. The physical and chemical properties of phenolic compounds make these molecules versatile ligands, capable of interacting with a wide range of targets, such as the Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1). CAs reversibly catalyze the fundamental reaction of CO? hydration to bicarbonate and protons in all living organisms, being actively involved in the regulation of a plethora of patho/physiological processes. This review will discuss the most recent advances in the search of naturally occurring phenols and their synthetic derivatives that inhibit the CAs and their mechanisms of action at molecular level.

The molecular structure of the neutral molecules and their radical anions, as well as their reactivity, are investigated. N-substituents include methyl and benzyl groups, while substituents on the aromatic rings cover electron-donor and electron-acceptor groups. Substitutions at the nitrogen atom do not significantly affect the geometry and frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) energies of these molecules. On the other hand, substituents on the aromatic rings modify the distribution of FMO. In addition, they influence the capability of these molecules to attach an additional electron, which was studied through adiabatic (AEA) and vertical electron affinities (VEA), as well as vertical detachment energy (VDE). To study electrophilic properties of these structures, local reactivity indices, such as Fukui (f?) and Parr (P?) functions, were calculated, and show the influence of the aromatic rings substituents on the reactivity of ?,?-unsaturated ketones towards nucleophilic attack. This study has potential implications for the design of curcumin analogues based on a 4-piperidone core with desired reactivity. </AbstractText>

The pivotal tumor suppressive role of p53-axis is indicated by the presence of inactivating mutations in TP53 gene in nearly all cancers. A close interaction between these two players, as well as the establishment of complex p53/miRNAs loops demonstrated the strong contribution of p53-effector miRNAs in enhancing the p53-mediated tumor suppression program. On the other hand, the direct and indirect targeting of p53, as well as the regulation of its stability and activity by specific microRNAs, underlie the importance of the fine-tuning of p53 pathway, affecting the cell fate of damaged/transformed cells. The promising results of miRNAs-based therapeutic approaches in preclinical studies and their entrance in clinical trials demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in several diseases, including cancer. Molecularly targeted drugs approved so far for HCC treatment show intrinsic or acquired resistances with disease progression in many cases, therefore the identification of effective and non-toxic agents for the treatment of HCC is actually an unmet clinical need. The knowledge of p53/miRNA inter-relations in HCC may provide useful elements for the identification of novel combined approaches in the context of the "personalized-medicine" era. </AbstractText>

Although recent literature has described a link between ailments such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer and a protective effect of polyphenols in the OLE, the mode of action is still unclear. Here, we describe a double-blinded placebo (PBO)-controlled trial, in which gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy male volunteers (n = 29) were analysed to identify genes that responded to OLE, following an eight-week intervention with 20 mL daily consumption of either OLE or PBO. Differences between groups were determined using an adjusted linear model. Subsequent analyses indicated downregulation of genes important in inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism and cancer as a result of OLE consumption. Gene expression was verified by real-time PCR for three genes (EGR1, COX-2 and ID3). The results presented here suggest that OLE consumption may result in health benefits through influencing the expression of genes in inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Future studies with a larger study group, including male and female participants, looking into direct effects of OLE on lipid metabolism and inflammation are warranted. </AbstractText>

Posttraumatic stress disorders and depressive and anxiety disorders are mental health conditions that co-occur at high rates in both adolescent and adult samples, and are linked to heightened impairment and disability. Comorbid chronic pain and psychopathology has been explained by the presence of shared neurobiology and mutually maintaining cognitive-affective and behavioral factors that lead to the development and/or maintenance of both conditions. Particularly within the pediatric chronic pain population, these factors are embedded within the broader context of the parent-child relationship. In this review, we will explore the epidemiology of, and current working models explaining, these comorbidities. Particular emphasis will be made on shared neurobiological mechanisms, given that the majority of previous research to date has centered on cognitive, affective, and behavioral mechanisms. Parental contributions to co-occurring chronic pain and psychopathology in childhood and adolescence will be discussed. Moreover, we will review current treatment recommendations and future directions for both research and practice. We argue that the integration of biological and behavioral approaches will be critical to sufficiently address why these comorbidities exist and how they can best be targeted in treatment. </AbstractText>

Currently, the diagnosis of osteoporosis mainly depends on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. However, these indexes are not sensitive and accurate enough to reflect the osteoporosis progression. Metabolomics offers the potential for a holistic approach for clinical diagnoses and treatment, as well as understanding of the pathological mechanism of osteoporosis. In this review, we firstly describe the study subjects of osteoporosis and bio-sample preparation procedures for different analytic purposes, followed by illustrating the biomarkers with potentially predictive, diagnosis and pharmaceutical values when applied in osteoporosis research. Then, we summarize the published metabolic pathways related to osteoporosis. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of chronological data and combination of multi-omics in fully understanding osteoporosis. The application of metabolomics in osteoporosis could provide researchers the opportunity to gain new insight into the metabolic profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms.

The efficiency of the extracts in producing nanoparticles were compared to commercially available brown algal fucoidans, a major constituent of brown algal aqueous extracts. The nanoparticles were characterised using TEM, XRD and UV/Vis spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. The rate of nanoparticle formation was assessed using UV/Vis spectroscopy and related to the size, shape and morphology of the nanoparticles as revealed by TEM. The antioxidant, reducing power and total polyphenolic contents of the aqueous extracts and fucoidans were determined, revealing that the aqueous extracts with the highest contents produced smaller, spherical, more monodisperse nanoparticles at a faster rate. The nanoparticles were assessed against two gram-negative bacteria, two gram-positive bacteria and one yeast strain. In contrast to the literature, the silver nanoparticles produced using the aqueous extracts were particularly toxic to Gram-negative bacteria, while the gold nanoparticles lacked activity. The cytotoxic activity of the nanoparticles was also evaluated against cancerous (HT-29, MCF-7) and non-cancerous (MCF-12a) cell lines. The silver nanoparticles displayed selectivity, since the MCF-12a cell line was found to be resistant to the nanoparticles, while the cancerous HT-29 cell line was found to be sensitive (10% viability).

These compounds cause mixed effects reminiscent of both microtubule depolymerizers and stabilizers. Immunofluorescence evaluations showed that each compound initially caused microtubule depolymerization and, surprisingly, with higher concentrations, microtubule bundles were also observed. There were subtle differences in the propensity to cause these competing effects among the compounds with a continuum of stabilizing and destabilizing effects. Tubulin polymerization experiments confirmed the differential effects and, while each of the compounds increased the initial rate of tubulin polymerization at high concentrations, total tubulin polymer was not enhanced at equilibrium, likely because of the dueling depolymerization effects. Modeling studies predict that the compounds bind to tubulin within the colchicine site and confirm that there are differences in their potential interactions that might underlie their distinct effects on microtubules. Due to their dual properties of microtubule stabilization and destabilization, we propose the name Janus for these compounds after the two-faced Roman god. The identification of synthetically tractable, small molecules that elicit microtubule stabilizing effects is a significant finding with the potential to identify new mechanisms of microtubule stabilization. </AbstractText>

Due to the absence of satellite signal in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), various technologies have been proposed for indoor applications. Among them, Wi-Fi fingerprinting has been attracting much interest from researchers because of its pervasive deployment, flexibility and robustness to dense cluttered indoor environments. One challenge, however, is the deployment of Access Points (AP), which would bring a significant influence on the system positioning accuracy. This paper concentrates on WLAN based fingerprinting indoor location by analyzing the AP deployment influence, and studying the advantages of coordinate-based clustering compared to traditional RSS-based clustering. A coordinate-based clustering method for indoor fingerprinting location, named Smallest-Enclosing-Circle-based (SEC), is then proposed aiming at reducing the positioning error lying in the AP deployment and improving robustness to dense cluttered environments.

27918455|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Adult-onset diseases, including hypertension, can originate from early life, known as the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). Because the developing kidney is vulnerable to early-life insults, renal programming is considered key in the developmental programming of hypertension. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, can regulate the NO-reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and is involved in the development of hypertension. Reprogramming interventions aimed at NO-ROS balance can be protective in both genetic and developmentally programmed hypertension. Here we review several emergent themes of the DOHaD approach regarding the impact of ADMA-related NO-ROS imbalance on programmed hypertension. We focus on the kidney in the following areas: mechanistic insights to interpret programmed hypertension; the impact of ADMA-related NO-ROS imbalance in both genetic and acquired animal models of hypertension; alterations of the renal transcriptome in response to ADMA in the developing kidney; and reprogramming strategies targeting ADMA-related NO-ROS balance to prevent programmed hypertension. </AbstractText>

This study aimed to investigate cervical cancer screening behaviour and its predictors among women aged 50 years or above. A population-based sample of 959 women was recruited by telephone from domestic households in Hong Kong, using random methods, and a structured questionnaire developed to survey participants. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the factors independently associated with cervical screening behaviour. Nearly half the sample (48%) had never had a cervical smear test. Multivariable analyses showed that age, educational level, marital status, family history of cancer, smoking status, use of complementary therapy, recommendation from health professionals, and believing that regular visits to a doctor or a Chinese herbalist were good for their health were predictors of cervical screening behaviour. Misconceptions concerned with menopause may reduce women's perceived susceptibility to cervical cancer, especially if they are 50 or above, and exert a negative effect on their screening behaviour. Healthcare professionals should actively approach these high-risk groups-older unmarried women, smokers, those less educated and who are generally not much concerned with their health. </AbstractText>

This calls for effective strategies and targeted interventions. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies relating to air pollution control on public health and health equity in Europe. Three databases, Web of Science, PubMed, and Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI), were searched for scientific publications investigating the effectiveness of strategies on outdoor air pollution control, public health and health equity in Europe from 1995 to 2015. A total of 15 scientific papers were included in the review after screening 1626 articles. Four groups of strategy types, namely, general regulations on air quality control, road traffic related emission control interventions, energy generation related emission control interventions and greenhouse gas emission control interventions for climate change mitigation were identified. All of the strategies reviewed reported some improvement in air quality and subsequently in public health. The reduction of the air pollutant concentrations and the reported subsequent health benefits were more significant within the geographic areas affected by traffic related interventions. Among the various traffic related interventions, low emission zones appeared to be more effective in reducing ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO?) and particulate matter levels. Only few studies considered implications for health equity, three out of 15, and no consistent results were found indicating that these strategies could reduce health inequity associated with air pollution. Particulate matter (particularly fine particulate matter) and NO? were the dominant outdoor air pollutants examined in the studies in Europe in recent years. Health benefits were gained either as a direct, intended objective or as a co-benefit from all of the strategies examined, but no consistent impact on health equity from the strategies was found. The strategy types aiming to control air pollution in Europe and the health impact assessment methodology were also discussed in this review. </AbstractText>

This study is mainly based on the construction of three different carbon paste sensors by the incorporation of DRZ with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to form dorzolamide-phosphotungstate (DRZ-PT) as an electroactive material in the presence of the solvent mediator ortho-nitrophenyloctyl ether (o-NPOE). The fabricated conventional carbon paste sensor (sensor I), as well as the other modified carbon paste sensors using ?-cyclodextrin (sensor II) and carbon nanotubes (sensor III), have been investigated. The sensors displayed Nernstian responses of 55.4 ± 0.6, 56.4 ± 0.4 and 58.1 ± 0.2 mV·decade(-1) over concentration ranges of 1.0 × 10(-5)-1.0 × 10(-2), 1.0 × 10(-6)-1.0 × 10(-2), and 5.0 × 10(-8)-1.0 × 10(-2) mol·L(-1) with lower detection limits of 5.0 × 10(-6), 5.0 × 10(-7), and 2.5 × 10(-9) mol·L(-1) for sensors I, II, and III, respectively. The critical performance of the developed sensors was checked with respect to the effect of various parameters, including pH, selectivity, response time, linear concentration relationship, lifespan, etc. Method validation was applied according to the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ICH guidelines. The developed sensors were employed for the determination of DRZ in its bulk and dosage forms, as well as bio-samples. The observed data were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained from other published methods. </AbstractText>

The inhibitory potential against two secretory phospholipase A? (sPLA?), three protease enzymes and eleven bacterial strains were evaluated. The results revealed that all compounds showed preferential inhibition towards hGIIA isoform of sPLA? rather than DrG-IB with compounds 6l and 6e being the most active. The tested compounds exhibited excellent antiprotease activity against proteinase K and protease from Bacillus sp. with compound 6l being the most active against both enzymes. Furthermore, the maximum zones of inhibition against bacterial growth were exhibited by compounds; 6a, 6m, and 6o against P. aeruginosa; 6a, 6b, 6d, 6f, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6o against Serratia; 6k against S. mutans; and compounds 6a, 6d, 6e, 6m, and 6n against E. feacalis.

This study measured the indoor air quality of underground platforms at 10 metro stations of the Taipei Rapid Transit system (TRTS) in Taiwan, including humidity, temperature, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO?), formaldehyde (HCHO), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), ozone (O?), airborne particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), bacteria and fungi. Results showed that the CO?, CO and HCHO levels met the stipulated standards as regulated by Taiwan's Indoor Air Quality Management Act (TIAQMA). However, elevated PM10 and PM2.5 levels were measured at most stations. TVOCs and bacterial concentrations at some stations measured in summer were higher than the regulated standards stipulated by Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration.

However, there is a lack of studies reporting the hypertension status of rural residents with minimum living allowances. We performed a cross-sectional study including 11,435 (5285 men and 6150 women) from the general population aged ?35 years in the Liaoning Province of China from 2012 to 2013, of which 1258 (11.0%) participants came from minimal assurance families. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory examinations and self-reported lifestyle factor information were collected by trained personnel. Multivariate logistic regression was used to detect the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and the risk of hypertension. We found that the prevalence of hypertension was as high as 61.9% in participants from minimal assurance families and the odd ratio for hypertension was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.15-1.52). The awareness, treatment, and control rates among treated hypertensive participants did not increase with higher level of income and education. In the total sample, the lower income levels increased the risk for hypertension, but education didn't show a significant association with hypertension. Thus, there is a severe hypertension situation in the Liaoning rural population of minimal assurance families, which need more attention and prevention and control measures for hypertension. </AbstractText>

Our aim was to compare pro-angiogenic responses of TRAIL, vascular endothelial growth-factor-A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast growth-factor-2 (FGF-2) either separately (10 ng/mL) or in combination, followed by the assessment of proliferation, migration and tubule formation using human microvascular endothelial-1 (HMEC-1) cells in vitro. Angiogenesis was also measured in vivo using the Matrigel plug assay. TRAIL and FGF-2 significantly augmented HMEC-1 cell proliferation and migration, with combination treatment having an enhanced effect on cell migration only. In contrast, VEGF-A did not stimulate HMEC-1 migration at 10 ng/mL. Tubule formation was induced by all three factors, with TRAIL more effective compared to VEGF-A, but not FGF-2. TRAIL at 400 ng/mL, but not VEGF-A, promoted CD31-positive staining into the Matrigel plug. However, FGF-2 was superior, stimulating cell infiltration and angiogenesis better than TRAIL and VEGF-A in vivo. These findings demonstrate that each growth factor is more effective at different processes of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Understanding how these molecules stimulate different processes relating to angiogenesis may help identify new strategies and treatments aimed at inhibiting or promoting dysregulated angiogenesis in people. </AbstractText>

We studied 1,292,462 women who had a first and singleton delivery between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1987. Each woman in the study cohort was tracked from their first childbirth to 31 December 2009. Vital status of the women was determined by crosswalking records with a computerized mortality database. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of death from BC associated with maternal age at first birth and parity. The data showed 63 BC deaths during 34,980,246 person-years of follow-up. BC mortality rate was 0.90 cases for every 100,000 person-years. Compared with women who gave birth under the age of 23, the adjusted HR was 1.24 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-2.35) for women who gave birth between age 23 and 26 and 2.30 (95% CI = 1.21-4.39) for women who gave birth over the age of 26. Increasing age at first birth (p for trend = 0.01) is associated with a trend in increasing risk of BC mortality. Relative to women who had a single childbirth, the adjusted HRs were 1.17 (95% CI = 0.51-2.69) for women who gave birth to two children, and 1.31 (95% CI = 0.56-3.10) for women with three or more childbirths, respectively. These results were not statistically significant. Study results suggests that giving birth at an early age may confer a protective effect on the risk of death from BC. </AbstractText>

Advances in understanding of the unique properties of these cells have inspired interest in their use as delivery vehicles for therapeutic genes, proteins, and drugs, or as "assistants" in the clean-up of aggregated proteins and other molecules when existing drainage systems are no longer adequate. The trafficking of myeloid cells from the periphery to the central nervous system is subject to complex cellular and molecular controls with several 'checkpoints' from the blood to their destination in the brain parenchyma. As important components of the neurovascular unit, the functional state changes associated with lineage heterogeneity of myeloid cells are increasingly recognized as important for disease progression. In this review, we discuss some of the cellular elements associated with formation and function of the neurovascular unit, and present an update on the impact of myeloid cells on central nervous system (CNS) diseases in the laboratory and the clinic. We then discuss emerging strategies for harnessing the potential of site-directed myeloid cell homing to the CNS, and identify promising avenues for future research, with particular emphasis on the importance of untangling the functional heterogeneity within existing myeloid subsets. </AbstractText>

Given the high levels of inflammatory parameters found in depressed elderly patients, the "inflammaging" hypothesis is gaining strength. In this systematic review, we summarize current evidence regarding the relationship between inflammatory parameters and late-life depression, with a unique focus on longitudinal studies to guarantee temporality. According to the data summarized in this review, the levels of some proinflammatory parameters-especially interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?-could serve as biomarkers for the future development of depressive symptoms in elderly patients. Proinflammatory cytokines seem to be associated with the future development of clinically significant depression, irrespective of baseline scores, thus indicating that inflammation temporally precedes and increases depression risk. As insufficient research has been conducted in this field, further prospective studies are clearly warranted. </AbstractText>

A website was developed to teach children dog safety via increased knowledge, improved cognitive skills in relevant domains, and increased perception of vulnerability to bites. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 69 children aged 4-5 randomly assigned to use the dog safety website or a control transportation safety website for ~3 weeks. Assessment of dog safety knowledge and behavior plus skill in three relevant cognitive constructs (impulse control, noticing details, and perspective-taking) was conducted both at baseline and following website use. The dog safety website incorporated interactive games, instructional videos including testimonials, a motivational rewards system, and messaging to parents concerning child lessons. Our results showed that about two-thirds of the intervention sample was not adherent to website use at home, so both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. Intent-to-treat analyses yielded mostly null results. Per-protocol analyses suggested children compliant to the intervention protocol scored higher on knowledge and recognition of safe behavior with dogs following the intervention compared to the control group. Adherent children also had improved scores post-intervention on the cognitive skill of noticing details compared to the control group. We concluded that young children's immature cognition can lead to dog bites. Interactive eHealth training on websites shows potential to teach children relevant cognitive and safety skills to reduce risk. Compliance to website use is a challenge, and some relevant cognitive skills (e.g., noticing details) may be more amenable to computer-based training than others (e.g., impulse control). </AbstractText>

Native to the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and Dokdo Island in the Sea of Japan, it is the only fern present on Dokdo Island. We isolated and characterized the chloroplast (cp) genome of C. falcatum, and compared it with those of closely related species. The genes trnV-GAC and trnV-GAU were found to be present within the cp genome of C. falcatum, whereas trnP-GGG and rpl21 were lacking. Moreover, cp genomes of Cyrtomium devexiscapulae and Adiantum capillus-veneris lack trnP-GGG and rpl21, suggesting these are not conserved among angiosperm cp genomes. The deletion of trnR-UCG, trnR-CCG, and trnSeC in the cp genomes of C. falcatum and other eupolypod ferns indicates these genes are restricted to tree ferns, non-core leptosporangiates, and basal ferns. The C. falcatum cp genome also encoded ndhF and rps7, with GUG start codons that were only conserved in polypod ferns, and it shares two significant inversions with other ferns, including a minor inversion of the trnD-GUC region and an approximate 3 kb inversion of the trnG-trnT region. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Equisetum was found to be a sister clade to Psilotales-Ophioglossales with a 100% bootstrap (BS) value. The sister relationship between Pteridaceae and eupolypods was also strongly supported by a 100% BS, but Bayesian molecular clock analyses suggested that C. falcatum diversified in the mid-Paleogene period (45.15 ± 4.93 million years ago) and might have moved from Eurasia to Dokdo Island. </AbstractText>

It inhabits freshwater ponds and pools and has been described as a living fossil. T. longicaudatus was officially declared an endangered species South Korea in 2005; however, through subsequent protection and conservation management, it was removed from the endangered species list in 2012. The limited number of available genetic resources on T. longicaudatus makes it difficult to obtain valuable genetic information for marker-aided selection programs. In this study, whole-transcriptome sequencing of T. longicaudatus generated 39.74 GB of clean data and a total of 269,822 contigs using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. After clustering, a total of 208,813 unigenes with an N50 length of 1089 bp were generated. A total of 95,105 unigenes were successfully annotated against Protostome (PANM), Unigene, Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases using BLASTX with a cut-off of 1E-5. A total of 57,731 unigenes were assigned to GO terms, and 7247 unigenes were mapped to 129 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, 1595 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected from the unigenes with 1387 potential SSR markers.

Chrysin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid found in herb and honeycomb, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. This study sought to determine the protective effects of chrysin on retinal neovascularization with abnormal vessels and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in 33 mM glucose-exposed human retinal endothelial cells and in db/db mouse eyes. High glucose caused retinal endothelial apoptotic injury, which was inhibited by submicromolar chrysin. This compound diminished the enhanced induction of HIF-1?, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in high glucose-exposed retinal endothelial cells. Consistently, oral administration of 10 mg/kg chrysin reduced the induction of these proteins in db/db mouse eye tissues. In addition, chrysin restored the decrement of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 junction proteins and PECAM-1 in hyperglycemia-stimulated retinal endothelial cells and diabetic mouse retina, possibly maintaining tight cell-cell interactions of endothelial cells and pericytes. Anti-apoptotic chrysin reduced the up-regulation of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 crucial to retinal capillary occlusion and BRB permeability. Furthermore, orally treating chrysin inhibited acellular capillary formation, neovascularization, and vascular leakage observed in diabetic retinas. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that chrysin had a capability to encumber diabetes-associated retinal neovascularization with microvascular abnormalities and BRB breakdown. </AbstractText>

A variety of assays are in use to study genetic damage endpoints. Human trials, of which there are rather few, tend to show decreases in endogenous DNA damage and protection against DNA damage induced ex vivo in blood cells. Most animal experiments have investigated the effects of polyphenols (often at high doses) in combination with known DNA-damaging agents, and generally they show protection. High concentrations can themselves induce DNA damage, as demonstrated in numerous cell culture experiments; low concentrations, on the other hand, tend to decrease DNA damage. </AbstractText>

Moreover, there are many classes predicted yet not experimentally verified by researchers. Recently, researchers have applied many CI methods to predict the classes of ncRNAs. However, the diverse CI approaches lack a definitive classification framework to take advantage of past studies. A few review papers have attempted to summarize CI approaches, but focused on the particular methodological viewpoints. Accordingly, in this article, we summarize in greater detail than previously available, the CI techniques for finding ncRNAs genes. We differentiate from the existing bodies of research and discuss concisely the technical merits of various techniques.

The motion is induced by a mass transport of the underlying photoresponsive polymer material occurring during irradiation with interference pattern. The polymer film contains azobenzene molecules that undergo reversible photoisomerization reaction from trans- to cis-conformation. Through a multi-scale chain of physico-chemical processes, this finally results in the macro-deformations of the film due to the changing elastic properties of polymer. The topographical deformation of the polymer surface is sensitive to a local distribution of the electrical field vector that allows for the generation of dynamic changes in the surface topography during irradiation with different light interference patterns. Polymer film deformation together with the motion of the adsorbed nano-particles are recorded using a homemade set-up combining an optical part for the generation of interference patterns and an atomic force microscope for acquiring the surface deformation. The particles undergo either translational or rotational motion. The direction of particle motion is towards the topography minima and opposite to the mass transport within the polymer film. The ability to relocate particles by photo-induced dynamic topography fluctuation offers a way for a non-contact simultaneous manipulation of a large number of adsorbed particles just in air at ambient conditions. </AbstractText>

The purpose of this study was to investigate the content and frequency of hazard management dealt by safety professionals in colleges. The authors also explored the effects of organizational factors/individual factors on SPs' perception of frequency of hazard management. The researchers conducted survey research to achieve the objective of this study. The researchers mailed questionnaires to 200 SPs in colleges after simple random sampling, then received a total of 144 valid responses (response rate = 72%). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the hazard management scale (HMS) extracted five factors, including physical hazards, biological hazards, social and psychological hazards, ergonomic hazards, and chemical hazards. Moreover, the top 10 hazards that the survey results identified that safety professionals were most likely to deal with (in order of most to least frequent) were: organic solvents, illumination, other chemicals, machinery and equipment, fire and explosion, electricity, noise, specific chemicals, human error, and lifting/carrying. Finally, the results of one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated there were four individual factors that impacted the perceived frequency of hazard management which were of statistical and practical significance: job tenure in the college of employment, type of certification, gender, and overall job tenure. SPs within colleges and industries can now discuss plans revolving around these five areas instead of having to deal with all of the separate hazards. </AbstractText>

Methods: The study population comprised 7855 patients aged ?40 years who were hospitalized for treatment of isolated moderate and severe TBI (an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ?3 points only in the head and not in other regions of the body) between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014. Patients were categorized as high-risk (OSTA score < -4; n = 849), medium-risk (-4 ? OSTA score ? -1; n = 1647), or low-risk (OSTA score > -1; n = 5359). Two-sided Pearson's chi-squared, or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical data. Unpaired Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to analyze normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity score-matching in a 1:1 ratio was performed using NCSS software, with adjustment for covariates. Results: Compared to low-risk patients, high- and medium-risk patients were significantly older and injured more severely. The high- and medium-risk patients had significantly higher mortality rates, longer hospital length of stay, and a higher proportion of admission to the intensive care unit than low-risk patients. Analysis of propensity score-matched patients with adjusted covariates, including gender, co-morbidity, blood alcohol concentration level, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Injury Severity Score revealed that high- and medium-risk patients still had a 2.4-fold (odds ratio (OR), 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-4.15; p = 0.001) and 1.8-fold (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.19-2.86; p = 0.005) higher mortality, respectively, than low-risk patients. However, further addition of age as a covariate for the propensity score-matching demonstrated that there was no significant difference between high-risk and low-risk patients or between medium-risk and low-risk patients, implying that older age may contribute to the significantly higher mortality associated with a lower OSTA score. Conclusions: Older age may be able to explain the association of lower OSTA score and higher mortality rates in patients with isolated moderate and severe TBI. </AbstractText>

Results: Among the 40 patients that were followed, the data showed that the antenatal dexamethasone exposure group (N = 24) had a significantly higher incidence of allergic diseases (75.0% vs. 18.8%, p < 0.0001) when compared to the non-dexamethasone exposure group (N = 16), especially with regard to asthma (41.7% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.003) and allergic rhinitis (58.3% vs. 18.8%, p = 0.013), but not atopic dermatitis. No statistical difference was observed in the mRNA expression levels of total white blood cell count between the dexamethasone exposure and non-exposure groups (p > 0.05). However, the asthma group had higher IL-5 levels (p = 0.009), and the MDI was shown to be significantly higher in the dexamethasone exposure group (90.38 ± 3.31 vs. 79.94 ± 3.58, p = 0.043) while no significant difference was found between the PDI of the two groups. Conclusions: Exposure to antenatal dexamethasone in preterm infants will increase their susceptibility to allergic diseases, particularly asthma and allergic rhinitis. Preterm infants' exposure to antenatal dexamethasone also results in higher MDI scores. Such increases in allergic diseases may be related to increased IL-5 and IL-10 levels. </AbstractText>

These peptides not only possess potent antimicrobial activity but exhibit low toxicity against eukaryotic cells. Therefore, they are considered as promising drug candidates for a number of diseases. In a recent study, potent antimicrobial activity was correlated with the conserved structures and cationic amphiphilic characteristics of members of this peptide family. A phylloseptin peptide precursor was discovered here in the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa tarsius and the mature peptide was validated by MS/MS sequencing, and was subsequently named phylloseptin-PT. The chemically-synthesized and purified phylloseptin-PT displayed activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Nevertheless, a range of cationicity-enhanced peptide analogues of phylloseptin-PT, which contained amino acid substitutions at specific sites, exhibited significant increases in antimicrobial activity compared to native phylloseptin-PT. In addition, alternative conformers which were designed and chemically-synthesized with d-lysine, showed potent antimicrobial activity and enhanced bioavailability. These data indicate that phylloseptins may represent potential candidates for next-generation antibiotics. Thus, rational design through modification of natural antimicrobial peptide templates could provide an accelerated path to overcoming obstacles en-route to their possible clinical applications. </AbstractText>

The geographical codes of study participants were all matched on the basis of the amount of parks and green areas in each administrative district. Compared with participants living in the highest quartile of parks and green areas (Quartile 4), those living in the lowest quartile of green and park area (Quartile 1) were at an increased risk of physician-diagnosed hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia currently under treatment. Participants in the lowest quartile of parks and green areas were likely not to engage in any moderate physical activity. After classifying hyperlipidemia risk depending on the presence of moderate physical activity, those participating in moderate physical activity were less likely to have hyperlipidemia in all quartiles of parks and green areas than those not engaging in moderate physical activity. We found that parks and green areas were associated with decreased hyperlipidemia risk. Physical activity, which may benefit from the presence of parks and green areas, may reduce hyperlipidemia risk. </AbstractText>

Such exposures can lead to epigenetic alterations like DNA methylation, which may be a marker of poor cognitive, motor and behavioral outcomes in the infant. Here we review studies that have assessed DNA methylation in cord blood following maternal exposures that may impact neurodevelopment of the child. We also highlight some key studies to illustrate the potential for DNA methylation to successfully identify infants at risk for poor outcomes. While the current evidence is limited, in that observations to date are largely correlational, in time and with larger cohorts analyzed and longer term follow-up completed, we may be able to develop epigenetic biomarkers that not only indicate adverse early life exposures but can also be used to identify individuals likely to be at an increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment even in the absence of detailed information regarding prenatal environment. </AbstractText>

We designed a fuzzy computing model that enables recognizing assigned movements in UHC with privacy. The movements are measured by the self-developed body motion sensor, which combines both accelerometer and gyroscope chips to make an inertial sensing node compliant with a wireless sensor network (WSN). The fuzzy logic process was studied to calculate the sensor signals that would entail necessary features of static postures and dynamic motions. Combinations of the features were studied and the proper feature sets were chosen with compatible fuzzy rules. Then, a fuzzy inference system (FIS) can be generated to recognize the assigned movements based on the rules. We thus implemented both fuzzy and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems in the model to distinguish static and dynamic movements. The proposed model can effectively reach the recognition scope of the assigned activity. Furthermore, two exercises of upper-limb flexion in physical therapy were applied for the model in which the recognition rate can stand for the passing rate of the assigned motions. Finally, a web-based interface was developed to help remotely measure movement in physical therapy for UHC. </AbstractText>

However, this kind of network is prone to large-scale communication failure if a few sensors physically fail. In this paper, to ensure that the network works normally, an effective fault-tolerance mechanism for ORSNs which mainly consists of backup on-road sensor deployment, redundant cluster head deployment and an adaptive failure detection and recovery method is proposed. Firstly, based on the N - x principle and the sensors' failure rate, this paper formulates the backup sensor deployment problem in the form of a two-objective optimization, which explains the trade-off between the cost and fault resumption. In consideration of improving the network resilience further, this paper introduces a redundant cluster head deployment model according to the coverage constraint. Then a common solving method combining integer-continuing and sequential quadratic programming is explored to determine the optimal location of these two deployment problems. Moreover, an Adaptive Detection and Resume (ADR) protocol is deigned to recover the system communication through route and cluster adjustment if there is a backup on-road sensor mismatch. The final experiments show that our proposed mechanism can achieve an average 90% recovery rate and reduce the average number of failed sensors at most by 35.7%. </AbstractText>

With the availability of genome editing tools such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and associated nuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9), it is now possible to perform site-specific alterations with relative ease, and will likely help realize the potential of this valuable model. In this article, we investigated for the first time a combination of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and direct injection of CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoprotein complex targeting GRB10 into the reconstituted oocytes to generate GRB10 ablated Ossabaw fetuses. This strategy resulted in highly efficient (100%) generation of biallelic modifications in cloned fetuses. By combining SCNT with CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection, genome edited animals can now be produced without the need to manage a founder herd, while simultaneously eliminating the need for laborious in vitro culture and screening. Our approach utilizes standard cloning techniques while simultaneously performing genome editing in the cloned zygotes of a large animal model for agriculture and biomedical applications. </AbstractText>

In recent years, functional nucleic acids, such as aptamers and nucleic acid enzymes, have shown great potential in biosensor development due to their excellent ability in target recognition and catalysis. Deoxyribozymes (or DNAzymes) are single-stranded DNA molecules with catalytic activity and can be isolated to recognize a wide range of analytes through the process of in vitro selection. By using various signal transduction mechanisms, DNAzymes can be engineered into fluorescent, colorimetric, electrochemical and chemiluminescent biosensors. Among them, colorimetric sensors represent an attractive option as the signal can be easily detected by the naked eye. This reduces reliance on complex and expensive equipment. In this review, we will discuss the recent progress in the development of colorimetric biosensors that make use of DNAzymes and the prospect of employing these sensors in a range of chemical and biological applications. </AbstractText>

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which spiders respond to heavy metals at the molecular level. In the present study, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was employed to characterize the de novo transcriptome of the spiders and to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after cadmium exposure. We obtained 60,489 assembled unigenes, 18,773 of which were annotated in the public databases. A total of 2939 and 2491 DEGs were detected between the libraries of two Cd-treated groups and the control. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that metabolism processes and digestive system function were predominately enriched in response to Cd stress. At the cellular and molecular levels, significantly enriched pathways in lysosomes and phagosomes as well as replication, recombination and repair demonstrated that oxidative damage resulted from Cd exposure. Based on the selected DEGs, certain critical genes involved in defence and detoxification were analysed. These results may elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying spiders' responses to heavy metal stress. </AbstractText>

A direct comparison between these strategies is drawn, yielding qualitatively similar results within a static framework. A number of analyses are performed to assess the accuracy of these different computational strategies under study based on a variety of numerical thresholds and optimization methods. Several basis sets and active spaces have also been calibrated to understand to what extent they can influence the resulting geometries and subsequent interpretation of the photochemical decay channels. The study shows small discrepancies between CASSCF and CASPT2 PEHs, displaying a shallow planar or twisted ¹(??*) minimum, respectively, and thus featuring a qualitatively similar scenario for supporting the ultrafast bi-exponential deactivation registered in thymine upon UV-light exposure. A deeper knowledge of the PEHs at different levels of theory provides useful insight into its correct characterization and subsequent interpretation of the experimental observations. The discrepancies displayed by the different methods studied here are then discussed and framed within their potential consequences in on-the-fly non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, where qualitatively diverse outcomes are expected. </AbstractText>

Eribulin has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic liposarcoma (LPS) patients previously treated with anthracyclines. This work investigated the mechanism of action of this innovative antitubulin agent in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS (ALT/DDLPS) which represents one of the most common adipocytic sarcoma histotypes. A primary culture of ALT/DDLPS from a 54-year-old patient was established. The anticancer activity of eribulin on the patient-derived primary culture was assessed by MTT and tunel assays. Eribulin efficacy was compared to other drugs approved for the treatment of STS. Cell migration and morphology were examined after exposure to eribulin to better understand the drug mechanism of action. Finally, Western blot analysis of apoptosis and migration proteins was performed. The results showed that eribulin exerts its antiproliferative effect by the arrest of cell motility and induction of apoptosis. Our results highlighted the activity of eribulin in the treatment of ALT/DDLPS patients. </AbstractText>

The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF IMS) was used to identify the most effective lipopeptide in situ. Meanwhile, the morphology of pathogen fungi treated with lipopeptides was observed via the SEM. Of the three lipopeptide families, surfactin, iturin, and fengycin, the last was identified as the most effective for inhibiting mycelium growth and conidial germination of PO. The conidia and hyphae of fengycin-treated PO were shown to become deformed and tumorous under exposure. This study provides insights into the antagonistic effect of Ba-BPD1 against fungal phytopathogens.

Ubiquitous in the human body, they are capable of replacing natural bases in double helices and give rise to four-stranded structures. Although the use of their fluorescence for analytical purposes was proposed, their fluorescence properties have not been properly characterized so far. The present paper reports the first fluorescence study of xanthine solutions relying on femtosecond spectroscopy. Initially, we focus on 3-methylxanthine, showing that this compound exhibits non-exponential fluorescence decays with no significant dependence on the emission wavelength. The fluorescence quantum yield (3 × 10(-4)) and average decay time (0.9 ps) are slightly larger than those found for the DNA bases. Subsequently, we compare the dynamical fluorescence properties of seven mono-, di- and tri-methylated derivatives. Both the fluorescence decays and fluorescence anisotropies vary only weakly with the site and the degree of methylation. These findings are in line with theoretical predictions suggesting the involvement of several conical intersections in the relaxation of the lowest singlet excited state. </AbstractText>

In testing at ambient conditions, IR thermography is ideal for this measurement. However, for higher Reynolds number testing, cryogenic facilities are often used, in which IR thermography is difficult to employ. In these facilities, temperature sensitive paint is an alternative with a temperature step introduced to enhance the natural temperature change from transition. Traditional methods for inducing the temperature step by changing the liquid nitrogen injection rate often change the tunnel conditions. Recent work has shown that adding a layer consisting of carbon nanotubes to the surface can be used to impart a temperature step on the model surface with little change in the operating conditions. Unfortunately, this system physically degraded at 130 K and lost heating capability. This paper describes a modification of this technique enabling operation down to at least 77 K, well below the temperature reached in cryogenic facilities. This is possible because the CNT layer is in a polyurethane binder. This was tested on a Natural Laminar Flow model in a cryogenic facility and transition detection was successfully visualized at conditions from 200 K to 110 K. Results were also compared with the traditional temperature step method. </AbstractText>

This study evaluated the effect of permanent AF on renal function in HFrEF and investigated the associations of atrial fibrillation, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with adverse clinical outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum NGAL levels measured by ELISA and NLR were compared between patients with sinus rhythm (HFrEF-SR, n=68), with permanent AF (HFrEF-AF, n=62), and a healthy control group (n=50). RESULTS Mean eGFR levels were significantly lower, and NLR and NGAL levels were significantly higher in the HFrEF patients than in the control patients but the difference between HFrEF-SR and HFrEF-AF was not statistically significant (NGAL: 95 ng/mL in HFrEF-SR, 113 ng/mL in HFrEF-AF and 84 ng/mL in the control group; p<0.001). Independent associates of baseline eGFR were age, hemoglobin, NLR, triiodothyronine, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. In a mean 16 months follow-up, adverse clinical outcome defined as progression of kidney dysfunction and composite of all-cause mortality and re-hospitalization were not different between HFrEF-SR and HFrEF-AF patients. Although NGAL was associated with clinical endpoints in the univariate analysis, Cox regression analysis showed that independent predictors of increased events were the presence of signs right heart failure, C-reactive protein, NLR, triiodothyronine, and hemoglobin. In ROC analysis, a NLR >3 had a 68% sensitivity and 75% specificity to predict progression of kidney disease (AUC=0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.85, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Presence of AF in patients with HFrEF was not an independent contributor of adverse clinical outcome (i.e., all-cause death, re-hospitalization) or progression of renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction in HFrEF was associated with both NLR and NGAL levels, but systemic inflammation reflected by NLR seemed to be a more important determinant of progression of kidney dysfunction. </AbstractText>

Our results showed that under both single and mixed N forms, influx rates of NO3(-) were much lower than those of NH4(+), suggesting a preference for NH4(+) in tea. With the increase in N concentration, the influx rate of NO3(-) increased more than that of NH4(+). The NH4(+) influx rates in a solution without NO3(-) were much higher than those in a solution with NO3(-), while the NO3(-) influx rates in a solution without NH4(+) were much lower than those in a solution with NH4(+). We concluded that (1) tea roots showed a preference for NH4(+), (2) presence of NO3(-) had a negative effect on NH4(+) influx, and (3) NH4(+) had a positive effect on NO3(-) influx. Our findings not only may help advance hydroponic tea experiments but also may be used to develop efficient fertilization protocols for soil-grown tea in the future. </AbstractText>

Although T cells arrive at the site of infection, they do not provide sterilizing immunity. The molecular basis of how Mtb impairs T-cell function is not clear. Mtb has been reported to block major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) antigen presentation; however, no bacterial effector or host-cell target mediating this effect has been identified. We recently found that Mtb EsxH, which is secreted by the Esx-3 type VII secretion system, directly inhibits the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Here, we showed that ESCRT is required for optimal antigen processing; correspondingly, overexpression and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that EsxH inhibited the ability of macrophages and dendritic cells to activate Mtb antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells. Compared with the wild-type strain, the esxH-deficient strain induced fivefold more antigen-specific CD4(+) T-cell proliferation in the mediastinal lymph nodes of mice. We also found that EsxH undermined the ability of effector CD4(+) T cells to recognize infected macrophages and clear Mtb. These results provide a molecular explanation for how Mtb impairs the adaptive immune response. </AbstractText>

However, a physiologically relevant role for the RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor activity of the IAV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), reported over a decade ago(2), remains unknown(3). Plant and insect viruses have evolved diverse virulence proteins to suppress RNAi as their hosts produce virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that direct specific antiviral defence(4-7) by an RNAi mechanism dependent on the slicing activity of Argonaute proteins (AGOs)(8,9). Recent studies have documented induction and suppression of antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic stem cells and suckling mice(10,11). However, it is still under debate whether infection by IAV or any other RNA virus that infects humans induces and/or suppresses antiviral RNAi in mature mammalian somatic cells(12-21). Here, we demonstrate that mature human somatic cells produce abundant virus-derived siRNAs co-immunoprecipitated with AGOs in response to IAV infection. We show that the biogenesis of viral siRNAs from IAV double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors in infected cells is mediated by wild-type human Dicer and potently suppressed by both NS1 of IAV as well as virion protein 35 (VP35) of Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. We further demonstrate that the slicing catalytic activity of AGO2 inhibits IAV and other RNA viruses in mature mammalian cells, in an interferon-independent fashion. Altogether, our work shows that IAV infection induces and suppresses antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian somatic cells. </AbstractText>

Surprisingly, despite the availability of effective antibiotic treatment since the mid-twentieth century, this bacterial infection, which is caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA), has been re-emerging globally in the last few decades with an estimated 10.6?million cases in 2008 (ref. 2). Although resistance to penicillin has not yet been identified, an increasing number of strains fail to respond to the second-line antibiotic azithromycin(3). Little is known about the genetic patterns in current infections or the evolutionary origins of the disease due to the low quantities of treponemal DNA in clinical samples and difficulties in cultivating the pathogen(4). Here, we used DNA capture and whole-genome sequencing to successfully interrogate genome-wide variation from syphilis patient specimens, combined with laboratory samples of TPA and two other subspecies. Phylogenetic comparisons based on the sequenced genomes indicate that the TPA strains examined share a common ancestor after the fifteenth century, within the early modern era. Moreover, most contemporary strains are azithromycin-resistant and are members of a globally dominant cluster, named here as SS14-?. The cluster diversified from a common ancestor in the mid-twentieth century subsequent to the discovery of antibiotics. Its recent phylogenetic divergence and global presence point to the emergence of a pandemic strain cluster. </AbstractText>

Odors almost never occur in isolation, and different odors excite overlapping populations of olfactory receptor neurons, so the central challenge of the olfactory system is to demix its input. Because of noise and the large number of possible odors, demixing is fundamentally a probabilistic inference task. We propose that the early olfactory system uses approximate Bayesian inference to solve it. The computations involve a dynamical loop between the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex, with cortex explaining incoming activity from the olfactory receptor neurons in terms of a mixture of odors. The model is compatible with known anatomy and physiology, including pattern decorrelation, and it performs better than other models at demixing odors. </AbstractText>

When different people recount the same events, how similar are their underlying neural representations? Participants viewed a 50-min movie, then verbally described the events during functional MRI, producing unguided detailed descriptions lasting up to 40 min. As each person spoke, event-specific spatial patterns were reinstated in default-network, medial-temporal, and high-level visual areas. Individual event patterns were both highly discriminable from one another and similar among people, suggesting consistent spatial organization. In many high-order areas, patterns were more similar between people recalling the same event than between recall and perception, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory. These results reveal the existence of a common spatial organization for memories in high-level cortical areas, where encoded information is largely abstracted beyond sensory constraints, and that neural patterns during perception are altered systematically across people into shared memory representations for real-life events. </AbstractText>

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying these genetic associations. Knowledge of the context that determines the nature and strength of eQTLs may help identify cell types relevant to pathophysiology and the regulatory networks underlying disease. Here we generated peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 2,116 unrelated individuals and systematically identified context-dependent eQTLs using a hypothesis-free strategy that does not require previous knowledge of the identity of the modifiers. Of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate (FDR) ? 0.05), 2,743 (12%) showed context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of these effects were influenced by cell type composition. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs depended on type I interferon signaling. Others were modulated by specific transcription factors binding to the eQTL SNPs. </AbstractText>

The genetic determinants of body fat distribution are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to gain new insights into the underlying genetics of body fat distribution by conducting sample-size-weighted fixed-effects genome-wide association meta-analyses in up to 9,594 women and 8,738 men of European, African, Hispanic and Chinese ancestry, with and without sex stratification, for six traits associated with ectopic fat (hereinafter referred to as ectopic-fat traits). In total, we identified seven new loci associated with ectopic-fat traits (ATXN1, UBE2E2, EBF1, RREB1, GSDMB, GRAMD3 and ENSA; P < 5 × 10(-8); false discovery rate < 1%). Functional analysis of these genes showed that loss of function of either Atxn1 or Ube2e2 in primary mouse adipose progenitor cells impaired adipocyte differentiation, suggesting physiological roles for ATXN1 and UBE2E2 in adipogenesis. Future studies are necessary to further explore the mechanisms by which these genes affect adipocyte biology and how their perturbations contribute to systemic metabolic disease. </AbstractText>

Identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been a powerful approach to infer the downstream effects of disease-associated variants, but most of these variants remain unexplained. The analysis of DNA methylation, a key component of the epigenome, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions. Here we show that disease-associated variants have widespread effects on DNA methylation in trans that likely reflect differential occupancy of trans binding sites by cis-regulated transcription factors. Using multiple omics data sets from 3,841 Dutch individuals, we identified 1,907 established trait-associated SNPs that affect the methylation levels of 10,141 different CpG sites in trans (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). These included SNPs that affect both the expression of a nearby transcription factor (such as NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3) and methylation of its respective binding site across the genome. Trans methylation QTLs effectively expose the downstream effects of disease-associated variants. </AbstractText>

Of these genome-wide significant loci, extraversion was associated with variants in WSCD2 and near PCDH15, and neuroticism with variants on chromosome 8p23.1 and in L3MBTL2.

The first genetic dimension separated personality traits and psychiatric disorders, except that neuroticism and openness to experience were clustered with the disorders. High genetic correlations were found between extraversion and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between openness and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The second genetic dimension was closely aligned with extraversion-introversion and grouped neuroticism with internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression or anxiety). </AbstractText>

During metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the contralateral side of the skull, and this migration is accompanied by extensive craniofacial transformations and simultaneous development of lopsided body pigmentation. The evolution of this developmental and physiological innovation remains enigmatic. Comparative genomics of two flatfish and transcriptomic analyses during metamorphosis point to a role for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid signaling, as well as phototransduction pathways. We demonstrate that retinoic acid is critical in establishing asymmetric pigmentation and, via cross-talk with thyroid hormones, in modulating eye migration. The unexpected expression of the visual opsins from the phototransduction pathway in the skin translates illumination differences and generates retinoic acid gradients that underlie the generation of asymmetry. Identifying the genetic underpinning of this unique developmental process answers long-standing questions about the evolutionary origin of asymmetry, but it also provides insight into the mechanisms that control body shape in vertebrates. </AbstractText>

However, day-length sensitivity in crops limits their geographical range of cultivation, and thus modification of the photoperiod response was critical for their domestication. Here we show that loss of day-length-sensitive flowering in tomato was driven by the florigen paralog and flowering repressor SELF-PRUNING 5G (SP5G). SP5G expression is induced to high levels during long days in wild species, but not in cultivated tomato because of cis-regulatory variation. CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mutations in SP5G cause rapid flowering and enhance the compact determinate growth habit of field tomatoes, resulting in a quick burst of flower production that translates to an early yield. Our findings suggest that pre-existing variation in SP5G facilitated the expansion of cultivated tomato beyond its origin near the equator in South America, and they provide a compelling demonstration of the power of gene editing to rapidly improve yield traits in crop breeding. </AbstractText>

However, no direct in vivo and in situ measurement of mechanical properties within developing 3D tissues and organs has yet been performed. Here we introduce a technique that employs biocompatible, magnetically responsive ferrofluid microdroplets as local mechanical actuators and allows quantitative spatiotemporal measurements of mechanical properties in vivo. Using this technique, we show that vertebrate body elongation entails spatially varying tissue mechanics along the anteroposterior axis. Specifically, we find that the zebrafish tailbud is viscoelastic (elastic below a few seconds and fluid after just 1 min) and displays decreasing stiffness and increasing fluidity toward its posterior elongating region. This method opens new avenues to study mechanobiology in vivo, both in embryogenesis and in disease processes, including cancer. </AbstractText>

The strength of this hybrid approach is shown by an application to the flexible multidomain protein Hsp90. The average solution structure of Hsp90's closed state resembles the known X-ray crystal structure with Angstrom precision. The open state is represented by an ensemble of conformations with interdomain fluctuations of up to 25 Å.

Large-scale expansions are commonly observed in human pedigrees and may be explained by iterative small-scale events such as strand slippage during replication or repair DNA synthesis. Alternatively, a distinct mechanism may lead to a large-scale repeat expansion as a single step. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a novel experimental system specifically tuned to analyze large-scale expansions of (CAG)n/(CTG)n repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The median size of repeat expansions was ?60 triplets, although we also observed additions of more than 150 triplets. Genetic analysis revealed that Rad51, Rad52, Mre11, Pol32, Pif1, and Mus81 and/or Yen1 proteins are required for large-scale expansions, whereas proteins previously implicated in small-scale expansions are not involved. From these results, we propose a new model for large-scale expansions, which is based on the recovery of replication forks broken at (CAG)n/(CTG)n repeats via break-induced replication. </AbstractText>

As levels of unfolded proteins decline, a metazoan-specific FIC-domain-containing ER-localized enzyme (FICD) rapidly inactivates the major ER chaperone BiP by AMPylating T518. Here we show that the single catalytic domain of FICD can also release the attached AMP, restoring functionality to BiP. Consistent with a role for endogenous FICD in de-AMPylating BiP, FICD(-/-) hamster cells are hypersensitive to introduction of a constitutively AMPylating, de-AMPylation-defective mutant FICD. These opposing activities hinge on a regulatory residue, E234, whose default state renders FICD a constitutive de-AMPylase in vitro. The location of E234 on a conserved regulatory helix and the mutually antagonistic activities of FICD in vivo, suggest a mechanism whereby fluctuating unfolded protein load actively switches FICD from a de-AMPylase to an AMPylase. </AbstractText>

Here, we report that telomere length is determined by the balance between telomere elongation, which is mediated by telomerase, and telomere trimming, which is controlled by XRCC3 and Nbs1, homologous recombination proteins that generate single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA and double-stranded telomeric circular DNA (T-circles), respectively. We found that reprogramming of differentiated cells induces T-circle and single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA accumulation, indicating the activation of telomere trimming pathways that compensate telomerase-dependent telomere elongation in hiPSCs. Excessive telomere elongation compromises telomere stability and promotes the formation of partially single-stranded telomeric DNA circles (C-circles) in hESCs, suggesting heightened sensitivity of stem cells to replication stress at overly long telomeres. Thus, tight control of telomere length homeostasis is essential to maintain telomere stability in hESCs. </AbstractText>

A major fraction of cellular hVKOR is in an intermediate redox state containing a Cys51-Cys132 disulfide, a characteristic accommodated by a four-transmembrane-helix structure of hVKOR. Warfarin selectively inhibits this major cellular form of hVKOR, whereas disruption of the Cys51-Cys132 disulfide impairs warfarin binding and causes warfarin resistance. Relying on binding interactions identified by cysteine alkylation footprinting and mass spectrometry coupled with mutagenesis analysis, we conducted structure simulations, which revealed a closed warfarin-binding pocket stabilized by the Cys51-Cys132 linkage. Understanding the selective warfarin inhibition of a specific redox state of hVKOR should enable the rational design of drugs that exploit the redox chemistry and associated conformational changes in hVKOR. </AbstractText>

H2AX interacts with HIF1? to prevent its degradation and nuclear export in order to allow successful VHL-independent HIF1? transcriptional activation. We show that mono-ubiquitylation and phosphorylation of H2AX, which are strictly mediated by hypoxia-induced E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 and ATM, critically regulate HIF1?-driven tumorigenesis. Importantly, TRAF6 and ?H2AX are overexpressed in human breast cancer, correlate with activation of HIF1? signalling, and predict metastatic outcome. Thus, TRAF6 and H2AX overexpression and ?H2AX-mediated HIF1? enrichment in the nucleus of cancer cells lead to overactivation of HIF1?-driven tumorigenesis, glycolysis and metastasis. Our findings suggest that TRAF6-mediated mono-ubiquitylation and subsequent phosphorylation of H2AX may serve as potential means for cancer diagnosis and therapy. </AbstractText>

Here we developed an inducible Y centromere-selective inactivation strategy by exploiting a CENP-A/histone H3 chimaera to directly examine the fate of missegregated chromosomes in otherwise diploid human cells. Using this approach, we identified a temporal cascade of events that are initiated following centromere inactivation involving chromosome missegregation, fragmentation, and re-ligation that span three consecutive cell cycles. Following centromere inactivation, a micronucleus harbouring the Y chromosome is formed in the first cell cycle. Chromosome shattering, producing up to 53 dispersed fragments from a single chromosome, is triggered by premature micronuclear condensation prior to or during mitotic entry of the second cycle. Lastly, canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but not homology-dependent repair, is shown to facilitate re-ligation of chromosomal fragments in the third cycle. Thus, initial errors in cell division can provoke further genomic instability through fragmentation of micronuclear DNAs coupled to NHEJ-mediated reassembly in the subsequent interphase. </AbstractText>

Transgenic mice were generated by transfer of the HBV pre-S/S gene together with its own promoter into C57B6 mice. Four lines of mice were created. Two of them carried wild-type gene and produced high and low levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (TgWT-H and L). The other two carried the sW172* mutation with high and low intrahepatic expression levels (TgSW172*-H and L). When sacrificed 18 months after birth, none of the TgWT mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), whereas 6/26 (23.1%) TgSW172*-H and 2/24 (8.3%) TgSW172*-L mice developed HCC (TgWT vs TgSW172*; P=0.0021). Molecular analysis of liver tissues revealed significantly increased expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 in TgSW172* mice, and decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large in TgSW172*-H mice. Higher proportion of apoptotic cells was found in TgSW172*-H mice, accompanied by increased cyclin E levels, suggesting increased hepatocyte turnover.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the interplay between hMYH DNA glycosylase and hMTH1 for cancer cell survival by using mismatch repair defective T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. To this end, MYH and MTH1 were silenced individually or simultaneously using small hairpin RNAs. Increased sub-G1 population and apoptotic cells were observed upon concurrent depletion of both enzymes. Elevated cell death was consistent with cleaved caspase 3 accumulation in double knockdown cells. Importantly, overexpression of the nuclear isoform of hMYH could remove the G1 arrest and partially rescue the toxicity observed in hMTH1-depleted cells. In addition, expression profiles of human DNA glycosylases were generated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR in MTH1 and/or MYH knockdown cells. NEIL1 DNA glycosylase, involved in repair of oxidized nucleosides, was found to be significantly downregulated as a cellular response to MTH1-MYH co-suppression.

Activation of the Notch signalling cascade has been implicated in cholangiocarcinogenesis. However, while several studies focused on the Notch receptors required for ICC development, little is known about the upstream inducers responsible for their activation. Here, we show that the Jagged 1 (Jag1) ligand is almost ubiquitously upregulated in human ICC samples when compared with corresponding non-tumorous counterparts. Furthermore, we found that while overexpression of Jag1 alone does not lead to liver tumour development, overexpression of Jag1 synergizes with activated AKT signalling to promote liver carcinogenesis in AKT/Jag1 mice. Histologically, tumours consisted exclusively of ICC, with hepatocellular tumours not occurring in AKT/Jag1 mice. Furthermore, tumours from AKT/Jag1 mice exhibited extensive desmoplastic reaction, an important feature of human ICC. At the molecular level, we found that both AKT/mTOR and Notch cascades are activated in AKT/Jag1 ICC tissues, and that the Notch signalling is necessary for ICC development in AKT/Jag1 mice. In human ICC cell lines, silencing of Jag1 via specific small interfering RNA reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis. Finally, combined inhibition of AKT and Notch pathways is highly detrimental for the in vitro growth of ICC cell lines. In summary, our study demonstrates that Jag1 is an important upstream inducer of the Notch signalling in human and mouse ICC.

Identification of specific responses in tissue where melanoma tumor cells are subjected to IPI-driven immune attack may reveal mechanisms of treatment efficacy or resistance, permitting refinement of targeted therapeutic approaches. We used NanoString digital barcoding chemistry to identify changes in the transcriptome of metastatic melanoma cells before and after IPI treatment using two comprehensive panels containing a total of 1330 unique genes. Only patients who developed autoimmune disorders following treatment, signifying a robust immune response, were included. Despite evidence of an enhanced immune response, most patients eventually exhibited disease progression. Overall, data from five pre-IPI tumors and four post-IPI tumor samples (from three patients) permitted identification of several candidate genes that showed increased expression based on normalized counts after therapy. These included TTK (~3.1-fold, P=1.18e-4), which encodes a dual-specificity protein tyrosine kinase, a known cell cycle regulator, and BIRC5 (~3.0-fold, P=9.36e-4), which encodes the antiapoptotic protein survivin.

The results obtained by the new technique were compared with that using Ishak fibrosis scores and two currently used quantitative methods for determining liver fibrosis: the collagen proportionate area (CPA) and measurement of hydroxyproline (HYP) content. We show that 11 shared morphological parameters faithfully recapitulate Ishak fibrosis scores in the models, with high area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) performance. The AUC values of 11 shared parameters were greater than that of the CPA (TAA: 0.758-0.922 vs 0.752-0.908; BDL: 0.874-0.989 vs 0.678-0.966) in the TAA mice and BDL rat models and similar to that of the CPA in the TAA rat and CCl4 mouse models. Similarly, based on the trends in these parameters at different time points, 9, 10, 7, and 2 model-specific parameters were selected for the TAA rats, TAA mice, CCl4 mice, and BDL rats, respectively. These parameters identified differences among the time points in the four models, with high AUC accuracy, and the corresponding AUC values of these parameters were greater compared with those of the CPA in the TAA rat and mouse models (rats: 0.769-0.894 vs 0.64-0.799; mice: 0.87-0.93 vs 0.739-0.836) and similar to those of the CPA in the CCl4 mouse and BDL rat models. Similarly, the AUC values of 11 shared parameters and model-specific parameters were greater than those of HYP in the TAA rats, TAA mice, and CCl4 mouse models and were similar to those of HYP in the BDL rat models. The automated evaluation system, combined with 11 shared parameters and model-specific parameters, could specifically, accurately, and quantitatively stage liver fibrosis in animal models.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 5 December 2016; doi:10.1038/labinvest.2016.128. </AbstractText>

We found that intracellular target engagement of unlabeled new therapeutics can be quantitated using polarized microscopy combined with competitive binding of matched fluorescent companion imaging probes. We quantitated the dynamics of target engagement of covalent BTK inhibitors, as well as reversible PARP inhibitors, in populations of single cells using a single companion imaging probe for each target. We then determined average in vivo tumor concentrations and found marked population heterogeneity following systemic delivery, revealing single cells with low target occupancy at high average target engagement in vivo. </AbstractText>

Stepwise oxidation obscures how each individual base forms and functions in epigenetic regulation, and prompts the question of whether TET enzymes primarily serve to generate hmC or are adapted to produce fC and caC as well. By mutating a single, conserved active site residue in human TET2, Thr1372, we uncovered enzyme variants that permit oxidation to hmC but largely eliminate fC and caC. Biochemical analyses, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, elucidated an active site scaffold that is required for wild-type (WT) stepwise oxidation and that, when perturbed, explains the mutants' hmC-stalling phenotype. Our results suggest that the TET2 active site is shaped to enable higher-order oxidation and provide the first TET variants that could be used to probe the biological functions of hmC separately from fC and caC. </AbstractText>

Within Drosophila, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is one of the Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) that act through Polycomb group response elements (PREs) to silence homeotic (HOX) and other PcG target genes. Using Drosophila, we identify new O-GlcNAcylated PcG proteins and develop an antibody-free metabolic feeding approach to chemoselectively map genomic loci enriched in O-GlcNAc using next-generation sequencing. We find that O-GlcNAc is distributed to specific genomic loci both in cells and in vivo. Many of these loci overlap with PREs, but O-GlcNAc is also present at other loci lacking PREs. Loss of OGT leads to altered gene expression not only at loci containing PREs but also at loci lacking PREs, including several heterochromatic genes. These data suggest that O-GlcNAc acts through multiple mechanisms to regulate gene expression in Drosophila. </AbstractText>

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a 7-kDa human microprotein we named non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide (NoBody). NoBody interacts with mRNA decapping proteins, which remove the 5' cap from mRNAs to promote 5'-to-3' decay. Decapping proteins participate in mRNA turnover and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NoBody localizes to mRNA-decay-associated RNA-protein granules called P-bodies. Modulation of NoBody levels reveals that its abundance is anticorrelated with cellular P-body numbers and alters the steady-state levels of a cellular NMD substrate. These results implicate NoBody as a novel component of the mRNA decapping complex and demonstrate potential functionality of a newly discovered microprotein. </AbstractText>

Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes ('biotypes') defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82-93%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies. </AbstractText>

Here we show that deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bax in osterix (Osx, also known as Sp7 transcription factor 7)-expressing cells in mice promotes HSC regeneration and hematopoietic radioprotection following total body irradiation. These mice showed increased bone marrow (BM) levels of the protein dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which was produced in Osx-expressing BM cells. Treatment of irradiated HSCs with Dkk1 in vitro increased the recovery of both long-term repopulating HSCs and progenitor cells, and systemic administration of Dkk1 to irradiated mice increased hematopoietic recovery and improved survival. Conversely, inducible deletion of one allele of Dkk1 in Osx-expressing cells in adult mice inhibited the recovery of BM stem and progenitor cells and of complete blood counts following irradiation. Dkk1 promoted hematopoietic regeneration via both direct effects on HSCs, in which treatment with Dkk1 decreased the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and suppressed senescence, and indirect effects on BM endothelial cells, in which treatment with Dkk1 induced epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion. Accordingly, blockade of the EGF receptor partially abrogated Dkk1-mediated hematopoietic recovery. These data identify Dkk1 as a regulator of hematopoietic regeneration and demonstrate paracrine cross-talk between BM osteolineage cells and endothelial cells in regulating hematopoietic reconstitution following injury. </AbstractText>

Intrauterine and systemic infection and inflammation cause 30-40% of spontaneous preterm labor (PTL), which precedes PTB. Although antibody production is a major immune defense mechanism against infection, and B cell dysfunction has been implicated in pregnancy complications associated with PTL, the functions of B cells in pregnancy are not well known. We found that choriodecidua of women undergoing spontaneous PTL harbored functionally altered B cell populations. B cell-deficient mice were markedly more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to PTL after inflammation, but B cells conferred interleukin (IL)-10-independent protection against PTL. B cell deficiency in mice resulted in a lower uterine level of active progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1), and therapeutic administration of PIBF1 mitigated PTL and uterine inflammation in B cell-deficient mice. B cells are a significant producer of PIBF1 in human choriodecidua and mouse uterus in late gestation. PIBF1 expression by B cells is induced by the mucosal alarmin IL-33 (ref. 9). Human PTL was associated with diminished expression of the ?-chain of IL-33 receptor on choriodecidual B cells and a lower level of active PIBF1 in late gestation choriodecidua. These results define a vital regulatory cascade involving IL-33, decidual B cells and PIBF1 in safeguarding term pregnancy and suggest new therapeutic approaches based on IL-33 and PIBF1 to prevent human PTL. </AbstractText>

However, the direct synthesis of MOF films with controlled crystalline orientation remains a significant challenge. Here we report a one-step approach, carried out under mild conditions, that exploits heteroepitaxial growth for the rapid fabrication of oriented polycrystalline MOF films on the centimetre scale. Our methodology employs crystalline copper hydroxide as a substrate and yields MOF films with oriented pore channels on scales that primarily depend on the dimensions of the substrate. To demonstrate that an anisotropic crystalline morphology can translate to a functional property, we assembled a centimetre-scale MOF film in the presence of a dye and showed that the optical response could be switched 'ON' or 'OFF' by simply rotating the film. </AbstractText>

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (?-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279?mA?h?g(-1) or 1,005?C?g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced ?-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized ?-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the ?-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo(4+) following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials. </AbstractText>

Photonic PT-symmetric systems that also support topological states could be useful for shaping and routing light waves. However, it is currently debated whether topological interface states can exist at all in PT-symmetric systems. Here, we show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the existence of such states: states that are localized at the interface between two topologically distinct PT-symmetric photonic lattices. We find analytical closed form solutions of topological PT-symmetric interface states, and observe them through fluorescence microscopy in a passive PT-symmetric dimerized photonic lattice. Our results are relevant towards approaches to localize light on the interface between non-Hermitian crystals. </AbstractText>

PMA-doped films show increased electrical conductivity and work function, reduced solubility in the processing solvent, and improved photo-oxidative stability in air. This approach is applicable to a variety of organic semiconductors used in photovoltaics and field-effect transistors. PMA doping over a limited depth of bulk heterojunction polymeric films, in which amine-containing polymers were mixed in the solution used for film formation, enables single-layer organic photovoltaic devices, processed at room temperature, with power conversion efficiencies up to 5.9 ± 0.2% and stable performance on shelf-lifetime studies at 60?°C for at least 280?h. </AbstractText>

The odds ratio (OR) for CTR >0.5 was 1.77 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-2.37], and the odds ratio for CTR >0.6 was 2.18 [95% CI, 1.44-3.30]. After adjusting for confounding variables, this difference continued to exhibit significant predictive power for CTR >0.6 (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.14-3.11), but the predictive power for CTR >0.5 was attenuated (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.98-2.03). In the subgroup analysis, PAOD was an independent factor for CTR >0.6, particularly in elderly and female patients or patients with hemoglobin >10?mg/dl and with no history of cardiovascular disease.

We perform a literature review and meta-regression of the cost per person per round of mass treatment against NTDs.

Benznidazole was used as a test drug. Variable volume (constant density) and variable density (constant volume) were used for the quantitative evaluation of parasite activity in calibrated wells of the VDRL plate. The desiccation process within the well was monitored as a function of volume and of the activity of the Biospeckle pattern of the parasites as well as the quantitative effect of the surface parasite quantity (proportion of the object's plane). A statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA, Tukey post hoc and Descriptive Statistics using R and R Commander. Conditions of volume (100?l) and parasite density (2-4x104 parasites/well, in exponential growth phase), assay time (up to 204min), frame number (11 frames), algorithm and program (RCommander/SAGA) for image processing were selected to test the effect of variable concentrations of benznidazole (0.0195 to 20?g/mL / 0.075 to 76.8?M) at various times (1, 61, 128 and 204min) on the activity of the Biospeckle pattern. The flat wells of the VDRL plate were found to be suitable for the quantitative calibration of the activity of Trypanosoma cruzi using the appropriate algorithm and program. Under these conditions, benznidazole produces at 1min an instantaneous effect on the activity of the Biospeckle pattern of T. cruzi, which remains with a similar profile up to 1 hour. A second effect which is dependent on concentrations above 1.25?g/mL and is statistically different from the effect at lower concentrations causes a decrease in the activity of the Biospeckle pattern. This effect is better detected after 1 hour of drug action. This behavior may be explained by an instantaneous effect on a membrane protein of Trypanosoma cruzi that could mediate the translocation of benznidazole. At longer times the effect may possibly be explained by the required transformation of the pro-drug into the active drug. </AbstractText>

When matched metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic data of the microbial communities are available, metaproteomic data analyses often employ a metagenome-guided approach, in which complete or fragmental protein-coding genes are first directly predicted from metagenomic (and/or metatranscriptomic) sequences or from their assemblies, and the resulting protein sequences are then used as the reference database for peptide/protein identification from MS/MS spectra. This approach is often limited because protein coding genes predicted from metagenomes are incomplete and fragmental. In this paper, we present a graph-centric approach to improving metagenome-guided peptide and protein identification in metaproteomics. Our method exploits the de Bruijn graph structure reported by metagenome assembly algorithms to generate a comprehensive database of protein sequences encoded in the community. We tested our method using several public metaproteomic datasets with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data acquired from complex microbial communities in a biological wastewater treatment plant. The results showed that many more peptides and proteins can be identified when assembly graphs were utilized, improving the characterization of the proteins expressed in the microbial communities. The additional proteins we identified contribute to the characterization of important pathways such as those involved in degradation of chemical hazards.

Cell proliferation in the budding yeast form is required for C. neoformans to infect human hosts, and virulence factors such as capsule formation and melanin production are affected by cell-cycle perturbation. Thus, understanding cell-cycle regulation is critical for a full understanding of virulence factors for disease. Our group and others have demonstrated that a large fraction of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is expressed periodically during the cell cycle, and that proper regulation of this transcriptional program is important for proper cell division. Despite the evolutionary divergence of the two budding yeasts, we found that a similar percentage of all genes (~20%) is periodically expressed during the cell cycle in both yeasts. However, the temporal ordering of periodic expression has diverged for some orthologous cell-cycle genes, especially those related to bud emergence and bud growth. Genes regulating DNA replication and mitosis exhibited a conserved ordering in both yeasts, suggesting that essential cell-cycle processes are conserved in periodicity and in timing of expression (i.e. duplication before division). In S. cerevisiae cells, we have proposed that an interconnected network of periodic transcription factors (TFs) controls the bulk of the cell-cycle transcriptional program. We found that temporal ordering of orthologous network TFs was not always maintained; however, the TF network topology at cell-cycle commitment appears to be conserved in C. neoformans. During the C. neoformans cell cycle, DNA replication genes, mitosis genes, and 40 genes involved in virulence are periodically expressed. Future work toward understanding the gene regulatory network that controls cell-cycle genes is critical for developing novel antifungals to inhibit pathogen proliferation. </AbstractText>

27918583|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Lens induction is a classical developmental model allowing investigation of cell specification, spatiotemporal control of gene expression, as well as how transcription factors are integrated into highly complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Pax6 represents a key node in the gene regulatory network governing mammalian lens induction. Meis1 and Meis2 homeoproteins are considered as essential upstream regulators of Pax6 during lens morphogenesis based on their interaction with the ectoderm enhancer (EE) located upstream of Pax6 transcription start site. Despite this generally accepted regulatory pathway, Meis1-, Meis2- and EE-deficient mice have surprisingly mild eye phenotypes at placodal stage of lens development. Here, we show that simultaneous deletion of Meis1 and Meis2 in presumptive lens ectoderm results in arrested lens development in the pre-placodal stage, and neither lens placode nor lens is formed. We found that in the presumptive lens ectoderm of Meis1/Meis2 deficient embryos Pax6 expression is absent. We demonstrate using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that in addition to EE, Meis homeoproteins bind to a remote, ultraconserved SIMO enhancer of Pax6. We further show, using in vivo gene reporter analyses, that the lens-specific activity of SIMO enhancer is dependent on the presence of three Meis binding sites, phylogenetically conserved from man to zebrafish. Genetic ablation of EE and SIMO enhancers demostrates their requirement for lens induction and uncovers an apparent redundancy at early stages of lens development. These findings identify a genetic requirement for Meis1 and Meis2 during the early steps of mammalian eye development. Moreover, they reveal an apparent robustness in the gene regulatory mechanism whereby two independent "shadow enhancers" maintain critical levels of a dosage-sensitive gene, Pax6, during lens induction. </AbstractText>

Such duplications have been found at the ace-1 locus (encoding the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides' target) in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (the major malaria vector); recent studies have revealed their intriguing complexity, consistent with the involvement of various numbers and types (susceptible or resistant to insecticide) of copies. We used an integrative approach, from genome to phenotype level, to investigate the influence of duplication architecture and gene-dosage on mosquito fitness. We found that both heterogeneous (i.e., one susceptible and one resistant ace-1 copy) and homogeneous (i.e., identical resistant copies) duplications segregated in field populations. The number of copies in homogeneous duplications was variable and positively correlated with acetylcholinesterase activity and resistance level. Determining the genomic structure of the duplicated region revealed that, in both types of duplication, ace-1 and 11 other genes formed tandem 203kb amplicons. We developed a diagnostic test for duplications, which showed that ace-1 was amplified in all 173 resistant mosquitoes analyzed (field-collected in several African countries), in heterogeneous or homogeneous duplications. Each type was associated with different fitness trade-offs: heterogeneous duplications conferred an intermediate phenotype (lower resistance and fitness costs), whereas homogeneous duplications tended to increase both resistance and fitness cost, in a complex manner. The type of duplication selected seemed thus to depend on the intensity and distribution of selection pressures. This versatility of trade-offs available through gene duplication highlights the importance of large mutation events in adaptation to environmental variation. This impressive adaptability could have a major impact on vector control in Africa. </AbstractText>

We first encode a protein sequence into a 440 dimensional feature vector consisting of a 400 dimensional Pseudo-Markov transition probability vector among the 20 amino acids, a 20 dimensional content ratio vector, and a 20 dimensional position ratio vector of the amino acids in the sequence. By evaluating the Euclidean distances among the representing vectors, we compare the similarity of protein sequences. We then apply this method into the ND5 dataset consisting of the ND5 protein sequences of 9 species, and the F10 and G11 datasets representing two of the xylanases containing glycoside hydrolase families, i.e., families 10 and 11. As a result, our method achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.962 with the canonical protein sequence aligner ClustalW in the ND5 dataset, much higher than those of other 5 popular alignment-free methods. In addition, we successfully separate the xylanases sequences in the F10 family and the G11 family and illustrate that the F10 family is more heat stable than the G11 family, consistent with a few previous studies. Moreover, we prove mathematically an identity equation involving the Pseudo-Markov transition probability vector and the amino acids content ratio vector. </AbstractText>

To gain competitive advantage, management of present-day transnational firms always seeks options to trim down various transaction and coordination costs, especially in the area of controllable intra-supply chain system. This study investigates a multi-product intra-supply chain system with failure in rework. To achieve maximum machine utilization, multiple products are fabricated in succession on a single machine. During the process, production of some defective items is inevitable. Reworking of nonconforming items is used to reduce the quality cost in production and achieving the goal of lower overall production cost. Because reworks are sometimes unsuccessful, failures in rework are also considered in this study. Finished goods for each product are transported to the sales offices when the entire production lot is quality assured after rework. A multi-delivery policy is used, wherein fixed quantity n installments of the finished lot are transported at fixed intervals during delivery time. The objective is to jointly determine the common production cycle time and the number of deliveries needed to minimize the long-term expected production-inventory-delivery costs for the problem. With the help of a mathematical model along with optimization technique, the optimal production-shipment policy is obtained. We have used a numerical example to demonstrate applicability of the result of our research. </AbstractText>

In this work, we compared transfection of supercoiled DNA vectors ranging from 383 to 4,548 bp, each encoding shRNA against GFP under control of the H1 promoter. We assessed knockdown of GFP by electroporation into HeLa cells. All of our vectors entered cells in comparable numbers when electroporated with equal moles of DNA. Despite similar cell entry, we found length-dependent differences in how efficiently the vectors knocked down GFP. As vector length increased up to 1,869 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole of transfected DNA increased. From 1,869 to 4,257 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole was steady, then decreased with increasing vector length. In comparing GFP knockdown with equal masses of vectors, we found that the shorter vectors transfect more efficiently per nanogram of DNA transfected. Our results rule out cell entry and DNA mass as determining factors for gene knockdown efficiency via electroporation. The length-dependent effects we have uncovered are likely explained by differences in nuclear translocation or transcription. These data add an important step towards clinical applications of non-viral vector delivery. </AbstractText>

This decline is concomitant with the morphological and functional maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. However, despite this association between maturation and loss of regenerative potential, little is known of the molecular changes that underlie these events. To identify these changes, we used RNA-seq to generate transcriptional profiles of purified cochlear supporting cells from 1- and 6-day-old mice. We found many significant changes in gene expression during this period, many of which were related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation of inner ear components and the maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. One example of a change in regenerative potential of supporting cells is their robust production of hair cells in response to a blockade of the Notch signaling pathway at the time of birth, but a complete lack of response to such blockade just a few days later. By comparing our supporting cell transcriptomes to those of supporting cells cultured in the presence of Notch pathway inhibitors, we show that the transcriptional response to Notch blockade disappears almost completely in the first postnatal week. Our results offer some of the first molecular insights into the failure of hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea. </AbstractText>

However, building a characteristic model of human dynamics on the Internet involves a complete analysis of the variations in human activity patterns, which is a complex process. This complexity is inherent in human dynamics and has not been extensively studied to reveal the structural composition of human behavior. A typical method of anatomizing such a complex system is viewing all independent interconnectivity that constitutes the complexity. An examination of the various dimensions of human communication pattern in online interactions is presented in this paper. The study employed reliable server-side web data from 31 known users to explore characteristics of human-driven communications. Various machine-learning techniques were explored. The results revealed that each individual exhibited a relatively consistent, unique behavioral signature and that the logistic regression model and model tree can be used to accurately distinguish online users. These results are applicable to one-to-one online user identification processes, insider misuse investigation processes, and online profiling in various areas. </AbstractText>

Common examples are the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation for the analysis of chromatin modifications or factor binding, enzymatic digestions for chromatin structure assays, and RNA sequencing to assess gene expression changes after biological perturbations. To investigate the pattern and abundance of coverage signals across regions of interest, data are often visualized as profile plots of average signal or stacked rows of signal in the form of heatmaps. We found that available plotting software was either slow and laborious or difficult to use by investigators with little computational training, which inhibited wide data exploration. To address this need, we developed SeqPlots, a user-friendly exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization software for genomics. After choosing groups of signal and feature files and defining plotting parameters, users can generate profile plots of average signal or heatmaps clustered using different algorithms in a matter of seconds through the graphical user interface (GUI) controls. SeqPlots accepts all major genomic file formats as input and can also generate and plot user defined motif densities. Profile plots and heatmaps are highly configurable and batch operations can be used to generate a large number of plots at once. SeqPlots is available as a GUI application for Mac or Windows and Linux, or as an R/Bioconductor package. It can also be deployed on a server for remote and collaborative usage. The analysis features and ease of use of SeqPlots encourages wide data exploration, which should aid the discovery of novel genomic associations. </AbstractText>

Method Our findings are based on data gathered through a brief questionnaire completed by a convenience sample of students prior to trialling new resource material. The questionnaire sought to understand the students' views about using IDD in science lessons. The classes involved in the study included one class from a primary school, five classes from a secondary school and one class from a school for visually impaired students. Results Approximately 20% of the participants thought that the diagrams were boring and just under half (48%) of the total sample (regardless of whether they were sighted or visually impaired) did not think diagrams were easy to use. Only 14% of the participants felt that repeated encounters with the same diagrams made the diagrams easy to understand. Unlike sighted students who can 'flit' across diagrams, a visually impaired student may only see or touch a small part of the diagram at a time so for them 'fliting' could result in loss of orientation with the diagram. Conclusions Treating sighted and visually impaired pupils equally is different to treating them identically. Sighted students incidentally learn how to interpret visual information from a young age. Students who acquire sight loss need to learn the different rules associated with reading tactile diagrams, or large print and those who are congenitally blind do not have visual memories to rely upon. </AbstractText>

Here we introduce a Python-based software tool, PyHillFit , and describe the underlying Bayesian inference methods that it uses, to infer probability distributions for these parameters as well as the level of experimental observation noise. The tool also allows for hierarchical fitting, characterising the effect of inter-experiment variability. We demonstrate the use of the tool on a recently published dataset on multiple ion channel inhibition by multiple drug compounds.

There are several regimens available for insulin initiation and maintenance. Insulin analogues have been developed to mimic normal physiology as closely as possible. Biphasic analogues can target both fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia, with the added advantage of being premixed and thus convenient for the patient. A practical and feasible option is to initiate insulin with one or more biphasic preparations at mealtimes, thus providing both basal and prandial coverage. Individual titration of dose and frequency of daily injections with biphasic insulin preparations has the potential for improving glycaemic control with a high degree of patient acceptance. Drawbacks include a more rigid regimen, a relative lack of flexibility, and a somewhat higher degree of glycaemic variability and hypoglycaemia when compared to multiple daily basal-bolus injections. Awareness of the advantages and limitations of biphasic insulin analogues can assist clinicians in their appropriate use for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. </AbstractText>

Real-time naked-eye detection of these contaminants is highly desirable to provide a direct and simple analytical method and address the challenges of the existing strategies. Using the detection of ricin and B. subtilis as an example, a naked-eye multiplex detection model is established. In this work, a green fluorogen with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics was encapsulated in silica nanoshells. The resulting green AIE nanoparticles (NPs) were further functionalized with ricin binding aptamers (RBA), which were used together with graphene oxide (GO) to provide a fluorescence turn-on approach recognizable by naked eye for the specific sensing of ricin. The platform is compatible with a red emissive fluorescent light-up probe (AIE-2Van) for B. subtilis detection. The success of the multiplex is validated by different colours, that is, green for ricin and red for B. subtilis, which are clearly recognizable by naked eye in the same solution. </AbstractText>

Specifically, we examined the difference in mental health when a young person was "not in the labor force" (NILF) (ie, non-working activity such as participating in education) compared to being in a job with varying levels of psychosocial quality. Method The data source for this study was the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) study, and the sample included 10 534 young people (aged ?30 years). We used longitudinal fixed-effects regression to investigate within-person changes in mental health comparing circumstances where individuals were NILF to when they were employed in jobs of varying psychosocial quality. Results Compared to when individuals were not in the labor force, results suggest a statistically significant decline in mental health when young people were employed in jobs with poor psychosocial working conditions and an improvement in mental health when they were employed in jobs with optimal psychosocial working conditions. Our results were robust to various sensitivity tests, including adjustment for life events and the lagged effects of mental health and job stressors. Conclusions If causal, the results suggest that improving the psychosocial quality of work for younger workers will protect and promote their wellbeing, and may reduce the likelihood of mental health problems later on. </AbstractText>

In this study, we elucidated water dynamics in MPDAHL using DVS, DSC, and low-field (1) H NMR. Based on the DVS data, we found that MPDAHL sorption kinetics obey a parallel exponential model. DSC results indicated that both water and heating could change the microstructure of MPDAHL. The T2 parameters of NMR reflected the different phases of moisture absorption revealed that there were 4 categories of water with different states or mobility in the MPDAHL during the moisture absorption process. The fastest fraction T2b mainly dominated the hygroscopicity of MPDAHL and the absorbed water significantly changed the proton distribution and structure of MPDAHL. Thus, this study shows that DVS, DSC, and low-field (1) H NMR are effective methods for monitoring water mobility and distribution in synthetic peptides. It can be used to improve the quality assurance of functional peptides. </AbstractText>

Different link functions can be selected to provide a rich family of models for longitudinal data. The model assumes that the time-varying effects are unspecified functions of time and the covariate-varying effects are parametric functions of an exposure variable specified up to a finite number of unknown parameters. The estimation procedure is developed using local linear smoothing and profile weighted least squares estimation techniques. Hypothesis testing procedures are developed to test the parametric functions of the covariate-varying effects. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators are established. A working formula for bandwidth selection is discussed and examined through simulations. Our simulation study shows that the proposed methods have satisfactory finite sample performance. The proposed methods are applied to the ACTG 244 clinical trial of HIV infected patients being treated with Zidovudine to examine the effects of antiretroviral treatment switching before and after HIV develops the T215Y/F drug resistance mutation. Our analysis shows benefits of treatment switching to the combination therapies as compared to continuing with ZDV monotherapy before and after developing the 215-mutation. </AbstractText>

We draw from the radiation chemistry and liquid cell electron microscopy literature to present solution chemistry and electron beam-based methods for selecting the radiolysis products formed and their relative amount during electron irradiation of liquid media in a transmission electron microscope. We outline various methods for establishing net oxidizing or net reducing reaction environments and propose solvents with minimal overall production of radicals under the electron beam. Exemplary liquid cell electron microscopy experiments in the fields of nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and degradation along with recommendations for best practices and experimental parameters are reported. We expect this review will provide researchers with a useful toolkit for designing general chemistry and materials science liquid cell electron microscopy experiments by 'directing' the effect of the electron beam to understand fundamental mechanisms of dynamic nanoscale processes as well as minimizing radiation damage to samples. </AbstractText>

Total phenol content decreased in all juices at both temperatures but there was a trend to lower levels in unpasteurized over pasteurized juices. Differences in the decline of total anthocyanins between pasteurized and unpasteurized juices varied according to the juice type and the storage temperature. At 4 °C storage, anthocyanins declined in all juices according to pseudo 1st-order kinetics and there were only small differences in the rates between pasteurized and unpasteurized juices. However, at 20 °C, although pasteurized and unpasteurized BC juices and pasteurized mixed juices followed pseudo 1st-order kinetics, there was a different pattern in unpasteurized mixed juices; a rapid initial decline was followed by a slowing down. The effect of the added juice on anthocyanin decline was also different at either temperature. At 4 °C, the anthocyanins decreased faster in mixed juices than BC juice alone, but at 20 °C, at least in pasteurized mixed juices, the decline was similar or even slower than in BC juice; there were only small differences among the 3 mixed juices. At 20 °C, in pasteurized and unpasteurized BC juices, the rate of decrease was essentially the same for all 4 individual anthocyanins but in the mixed juices the 2 glucosides decreased significantly faster than the 2 rutinosides. </AbstractText>

To investigate the top-down effects of waterfowl on wetland biogeochemistry, we implemented exclosure experiments in a major waterfowl overwintering wetland in the southeastern United States over two growing seasons. We found that herbivory inhibited the oxidation of CH4 , leading to a mean increase in emission by 230% over control plots, and prevented nitrification, as indicated by low nitrate availability and undetectable emissions of nitrous oxide. Herbivory reduced belowground biomass of macrophytes, retarding the subsequent spring emergence of aerenchymous stems, effectively starving wetland soils of oxygen necessary for CH4 oxidation and nitrification. The recognition that important populations of aquatic herbivores may influence the capacity for wetlands to emit greenhouse gases and cycle N is particularly salient in the context of climate change and nutrient pollution mitigation goals. For example, our results suggest that (1) annual emissions of 23 Gg CH4 /yr from ~57 000 ha of publicly owned waterfowl impoundments in the southeastern United States could be tripled by overgrazing and that (2) waterfowl impoundments may export as much N as agricultural fields. We discuss potential implications for habitat management in the context of historic wetland loss and waterfowl population recovery. </AbstractText>

Included studies compared NO donors with placebo, vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), intracervical PGE2, vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foley catheter. The majority of the included studies were assessed as being at low risk of bias. Nitric oxide versus placebo There was no evidence of a difference for any of the primary outcomes analysed: vaginal delivery not achieved in 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.15; one trial, 238 women; low-quality evidence), uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.62; two trials, 300 women; low-quality evidence), caesarean section (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11; nine trials, 2624 women; moderate-quality evidence) or serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death (average RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.08 to 33.26; two trials, 1712 women; low-quality evidence). There were no instances of serious maternal morbidity or death (one study reported this outcome).There was a reduction in an unfavourable cervix at 12 to 24 hours in women treated with NO donors (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; four trials, 762 women), and this difference was observed in both subgroups of standard release and slow release formulation. Women who received NO donors were less likely to experience uterine hyperstimulation without FHR rate changes (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.80; one trial, 200 women), and more likely to experience side effects, including nausea, headache and vomiting. Nitric oxide donors versus vaginal prostaglandins There was no evidence of any difference between groups for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes or caesarean section (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21; three trials, 571 women). Serious neonatal morbidity and serious maternal morbidity were not reported. There were fewer women in the NO donor group who did not achieve a vaginal delivery within 24 hours (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86; one trial, 400 primiparae women). Nitric oxide donors versus intracervical prostaglandins One study reported a reduction in the number of women who had not achieved a vaginal delivery within 24 hours with NO donors (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86; one trial, 400 women). This result should be interpreted with caution as the information was extracted from an abstract only and a full report of the study is awaited. No differences were observed between groups for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.74; one trial, 42 women) or serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.74; one trial, 42 women). Fewer women in the NO donor group underwent a caesarean section in comparison to women who received intracervical prostaglandins (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; two trials, 442 women). No study reported on the outcome serious maternal morbidity or death. Nitric oxide donors versus vaginal misoprostol There was a reduction in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes with NO donors (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37; three trials, 281 women). There were no differences in caesarean section rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.21; 761 women; six trials) and no cases of serious neonatal morbidity/perinatal death were reported. One study found that women in the NO donor group were more likely to not deliver within 24 hours (RR 5.33, 95% CI 1.62 to 17.55; one trial, 150 women). Serious maternal morbidity or death was not reported.In terms of secondary outcomes, there was an increase in cervix unchanged/unfavourable with NO (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.07 to 5.66; two trials, 151 women) and an increase in the need for oxytocin augmentation with NO induction (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.45; 7 trials; 767 women), although there was evidence of significant heterogeneity which could not be fully explained. Uterine hyperstimulation without FHR was lower in the NO group, as was meconium-stained liquor, Apgar score less than seven at five minutes and analgesia requirements. Nitric oxide donors versus intracervical catheter There was no evidence on any difference between the effects of NO and the use of a Foley catheter for induction of labour for caesarean section (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.59; one trial, 80 women). No other primary outcomes were reported. One study of 75 participants did not contribute any data to the review.For all comparisons, women who received NO donors were more likely to experience side effects such as headache, nausea or vomiting. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Available data suggests that NO donors can be a useful tool in the process of induction of labour causing the cervix to be more favourable in comparison to placebo.

Gaining quantitative information on such rotaxanes in which the ring distribution between the two stations is largely nonsymmetric has proven to be very challenging. Here we report on two independent experimental methodologies - based on luminescence lifetime measurement and acid-base titrations - to determine the relative populations of the two co-conformations of a [2]rotaxane. The assays yield convergent results and are sensitive enough to measure an equilibrium constant (K ~ 4000) out of reach for NMR spectroscopy. We also estimate the ring distribution constant in the switched (deprotonated) state (K'<10-4), and report the highest positional efficiency for stimuli-induced shuttling to date (>99.92%). Finally, our results show that the pKa of the pH-responsive station depends on the ring affinity of the pH-insensitive station, an observation that paves the way for the design of new artificial allosteric systems. </AbstractText>

Glycerol, a common used plasticizer, also impacts on mechanical properties of the film. A factorial design was used to investigate the effects of gallic acid and glycerol concentrations on antioxidant activities and mechanical properties of fish gelatin film. Increasing the amount of gallic acid increased the antioxidant capacities of the film measured by radical scavenging assay and the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay. The released antioxidant power of gallic acid from the film was not reduced by glycerol. The presence of gallic acid not only increased the antioxidant capacity of the film, but also increased the tensile strength, elongation at break, and reduced UV absorption due to interaction between gallic acid and protein by hydrogen bonding. Glycerol did not affect the antioxidant capacities of the film, but increased the elasticity of the films. Overall, this study revealed that gallic acid entrapped in the fish gelatin film provided antioxidant activities and improved film characteristics, namely UV barrier, strength, and elasticity of the film. </AbstractText>

Here, we start by identifying individual particles and estimate the diffusion coefficient for each particle by a maximum likelihood method. Averaging over the particles gives a diffusion coefficient estimate for the whole image. In examples both with simulated and experimental data, we show that the new method gives accurate estimates. It also gives directly standard error estimates. The method should be possible to extend to study heterogeneous materials and systems of particles with varying diffusion coefficient, as demonstrated in a simple simulation example. A requirement for applying the SPRIA method is that the particle concentration is low enough so that we can identify the individual particles. We also describe a bootstrap method for estimating the standard error of standard RICS. </AbstractText>

Here we assess how climatic factors and evolutionary events shape fungal-algal association patterns in the widely distributed lichen-forming fungal genus Protoparmelia. Multilocus phylogenies of fungal and algal partners were generated using 174 specimens. Coalescent-based species delimitation analysis suggested that 23 fungal hosts are associating with 20 algal species. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to infer how fungal-algal association patterns varied with climate. Fungi associated with one to three algal partners whereas algae accepted one to five fungal partners. Both fungi and algae were more specific, associating with fewer partners, in the warmer climates. Interaction with more than one partner was more frequent in cooler climates for both the partners. Cophylogenetic analyses suggest congruent fungal-algal phylogenies. Host switch was a more common event in warm climates, whereas failure of the photobiont to diverge with its fungal host was more frequent in cooler climates. We conclude that both environmental factors and evolutionary events drive fungal and algal evolution in Protoparmelia. The processes leading to phylogenetic congruence of fungi and algae are different in different macrohabitats in our study system. Hence, closely related species inhabiting diverse habitats may follow different evolutionary pathways. </AbstractText>

However, its role in C4 photosynthesis is poorly understood because it has been historically difficult to estimate. We use two methods to derive the temperature responses of gm in C4 species. The first (?(18) O) combines measurements of gas exchange with models and measurements of (18) O discrimination. The second method (in vitro Vpmax ) derives gm by retrofitting models of C4 photosynthesis and (13) C discrimination with gas exchange, kinetic constants and in vitro Vpmax measurements. The two methods produced similar gm for Setaria viridis and Zea mays. Additionally, we present the first temperature response (10-40°C) of C4 gm in S. viridis, Z. mays and Miscanthus × giganteus. Values for gm at 25°C ranged from 2.90 to 7.85 ?mol m(-2)  s(-1)  Pa(-1) . Our study demonstrated that: the two described methods are suitable to calculate gm in C4 species; gm values in C4 are similar to high-end values reported for C3 species; and gm increases with temperature analogous to reports for C3 species and the response is species specific. These results improve our mechanistic understanding of C4 photosynthesis. </AbstractText>

Because ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi provide ideal opportunities to test the relationship between host shifts and diversification, we tested whether mutualism with new host lineages could increase the diversification rates of ECM fungi. Using a Bayesian tree inferred from 23 027-base nucleotide sequences of 80 single-copy genes, we tested whether the diversification rate had changed through host-shift events in the monophyletic clade containing the ECM fungal genera Strobilomyces and Afroboletus. The results indicated that these fungi were initially associated with Caesalpinioideae/Monotoideae in Africa, acquired associations with Dipterocarpoideae in tropical Asia, and then switched to Fagaceae/Pinaceae and Nothofagaceae/Eucalyptus. Fungal lineages associated with Fagaceae/Pinaceae were inferred to have approximately four-fold and two-fold greater diversification rates than those associated with Caesalpinioideae/Monotoideae and Dipterocarpoideae or Nothofagaceae/Eucalyptus, respectively. Moreover, the diversification rate shift was inferred to follow the host shift to Fagaceae/Pinaceae. Our study suggests that host-shift events, particularly those occurring with respect to Fagaceae/Pinaceae, can provide ecological opportunities for the rapid diversification of Strobilomyces-Afroboletus. Although further studies are needed for generalization, we propose a possible diversification scenario of ECM fungi. </AbstractText>

Shoot Na concentrations were determined in 334 angiosperm species, representing 35 orders, grown hydroponically in a nonsaline solution. Many Caryophyllales species exhibited abnormally large [Na]shoot when grown hydroponically in a nonsaline solution. The bimodal distribution of the log-normal [Na]shoot of species within the Caryophyllales suggested at least two distinct [Na]shoot phenotypes within this order. Mapping the trait of Na-hyperaccumulation onto the phylogenetic relationships between Caryophyllales families, and between subfamilies within the Amaranthaceae, suggested that the trait evolved several times within this order: in an ancestor of the Aizoaceae, but not the Phytolaccaceae or Nyctaginaceae, in ancestors of several lineages formerly classified as Chenopodiaceae, but not in the Amaranthaceae sensu stricto, and in ancestors of species within the Cactaceae, Portulacaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Tamaricaceae and Polygonaceae. In conclusion, a disproportionate number of Caryophyllales species behave as Na-hyperaccumulators, and multiple evolutionary origins of this trait can be identified within this order. </AbstractText>

By contrast, this is not true for samples in the micrometre size range, in large part because of the difficulties associated with sample preparation starting from a 'bulk' material. There are also many advantages inherent to the study of micrometre-sized samples compared to their nanometre-sized counterparts. Here, we present a liquid cell transmission electron study that employed an innovative sample preparation technique using focused ion beam (FIB) milling to fabricate micrometre-sized electron transparent lamellae that were then welded to the liquid cell substrate. This technique, for which we have described in detail all of the fabrication steps, allows for samples having dimensions of several square micrometres to be observed by TEM in situ in a liquid. We applied this technique to test whether we could observe and measure in situ dissolution of a crystalline material called wollastonite, a calcium silicate mineral. More specifically, this study was used to observe and record surface dynamics associated with step and terrace edge movement, which are ultimately linked to the overall rate of dissolution. The wollastonite lamella underwent chemical reactions in pure deionized water at ambient temperature in a liquid cell with a 5-?m-spacer thickness. The movement of surface steps and terraces was measured periodically over a period of almost 5 h. Quite unexpectedly, the one-dimensional rates of retreat of these surface features were not constant, but changed over time. In addition, there were noticeable quantitative differences in retreat rates as a function crystallographic orientation, indicating that surface retreat is anisotropic. Several bulk rates of dissolution were also determined (1.6-4.2  10(-7) mol m(-2) s(-1) ) using the rates of retreat of representative terraces and steps, and were found to be within one order of magnitude of dissolution rates in the literature based on aqueous chemistry data. </AbstractText>

However, the genotypic variation and the genomic regions governing spike ethylene (SET) production in wheat under long-term heat stress remain unexplored. We investigated genotypic variation in the production of SET and its relationship with spike dry weight (SDW) in 130 diverse wheat elite lines and landraces under heat-stressed field conditions. We employed an Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array to identify the genetic loci for SET and SDW through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a subset of the Wheat Association Mapping Initiative (WAMI) panel. The SET and SDW exhibited appreciable genotypic variation among wheat genotypes at the anthesis stage. There was a strong negative correlation between SET and SDW. The GWAS uncovered five and 32 significant SNPs for SET, and 22 and 142 significant SNPs for SDW, in glasshouse and field conditions, respectively. Some of these SNPs closely localized to the SNPs for plant height, suggesting close associations between plant height and spike-related traits. The phenotypic and genetic elucidation of SET and its relationship with SDW supports future efforts toward gene discovery and breeding wheat cultivars with reduced ethylene effects on yield under heat stress. </AbstractText>

References SUMMARY: Plant iron (Fe) uptake relies to a large extent on the capacity of cells to control and extract Fe pools safely conserved in extracytoplasmic environments such as the apoplast and vacuoles, at least as much as on the transport machinery nested in plasma membranes. Recent studies on root and embryo Fe nutrition support this assertion and show that the root Fe-deficiency response also includes the dynamic use of a large Fe reservoir bound to cell wall components in the root apoplast, secretion in the apoplast of phenolic compounds of the coumarin family, which solubilize Fe in calcareous soils, and inhibition of suberization of endodermal cells in order to allow apoplastic and transcellular radial transport of Fe. All of these responses are regulated by the stress hormones ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA), suggesting an integrated strategy within the root to adapt to Fe shortage. For its nutrition, the embryo has developed both an original uptake mechanism, in which ascorbate is effluxed to chemically reduce Fe(3+) to the transport-competent Fe(2+) form, and an efficient strategy to control utilization of a large Fe pool in vacuoles. This review will attempt to summarize exciting new insights into the diverse routes that Fe takes to feed plant tissues. </AbstractText>

A total of 14 adolescents with ABI were initially recruited, and 12 were included in the final analysis (n = 6 each). They were randomly assigned to the experimental (RAS) or the control (conventional gait training) groups. The experimental group received gait training with RAS three times a week for 4 weeks. For both groups, spatiotemporal parameters and kinematic data, such as dynamic motions of joints on three-dimensional planes during a gait cycle and the range of motion in each joint, were collected. Significant group differences in pre-post changes were observed in cadence, walking velocity, and step time, indicating that there were greater improvements in those parameters in the RAS group compared with the control group. Significant increases in hip and knee motions in the sagittal plane were also observed in the RAS group. The changes in kinematic data significantly differed between groups, particularly from terminal stance to mid-swing phase. An increase of both spatiotemporal parameters and corresponding kinematic changes of hip and knee joints after RAS protocol indicates that the use of rhythmic cueing may change gait patterns in adolescents with ABI. </AbstractText>

The capability to transform 3D objects from one shape to another, right off the print bed, is known as 4D printing. Shape memory thermosets can be tailored to have a range of thermomechanical properties favorable to medical devices, but processing them is a challenge because they are insoluble and do not flow at any temperature. This study presents here a strategy to capitalize on a series of medical imaging modalities to construct a printable shape memory endoluminal device, exemplified by a tracheal stent. A methacrylated polycaprolactone precursor with a molecular weight of 10 000 g mol(-1) is printed with a UV-LED stereolithography printer based on anatomical data. This approach converges with the zeitgeist of personalized medicine and it is anticipated that it will broadly expand the application of shape memory-exhibiting biomedical devices to myriad clinical indications. </AbstractText>

Herein, we describe a small molecule microarray-based strategy for high-throughput synthesis, screening of >1000 potential bidentate inhibitors of PARPs, and the successful discovery of a potent PARP14 inhibitor H10 with >20-fold selectivity over PARP1. Co-crystallization of the PARP14/H10 complex indicated H10 bound to both the nicotinamide and the adenine subsites.

Detection and characterization of viral pathogens require accurate, sensitive, and rapid diagnostic assays. For field and clinical samples, the sample preparation procedures limit the ultimate performance and utility of the overall virus diagnostic protocols. This study presents the development of a microfluidic device embedded with porous silicon nanowire (pSiNW) forest for label-free size-based point-of-care virus capture in a continuous curved flow design. The pSiNW forests with specific interwire spacing are synthesized in situ on both bottom and sidewalls of the microchannels in a batch process. With the enhancement effect of Dean flow, this study demonstrates that about 50% H5N2 avian influenza viruses are physically trapped without device clogging. A unique feature of the device is that captured viruses can be released by inducing self-degradation of the pSiNWs in physiological aqueous environment. About 60% of captured viruses can be released within 24 h for virus culture, subsequent molecular diagnosis, and other virus characterization and analyses. This device performs viable, unbiased, and label-free virus isolation and release. It has great potentials for virus discovery, virus isolation and culture, functional studies of virus pathogenicity, transmission, drug screening, and vaccine development. </AbstractText>

Each rat has a polymer implanted on one side of the cortex and a sham craniotomy performed on the other side. After a period of seven weeks, rats are euthanized and parallel series of coronal sections are cut throughout the implant site. Four series of 15 sections are histological (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemically (neuron-specific nuclear protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and anti-CD68 antibody) stained and evaluated by three investigators. The results show that implanted PPy mats do not induce obvious inflammation, trauma, gliosis, and neuronal toxicity. Therefore the authors conclude the PPy used offer good histocompatibility with central nervous system cells and that PPy sheets can be used as intracranial, AED delivery implant. </AbstractText>

This strategy is versatile for a variety of negatively charged CNDs with different emission colors. The advantage of the resultant hybrid phosphors is that their luminescence exhibits excellent thermal and photostability, as well as remarkable resistance to strong acid/alkali and common organic solvents.

Herein, a novel supramolecular oligomer cytosine (Cy)-polypropylene glycol containing self-complementary multiple hydrogen-bonded Cy moieties is developed, which undergoes spontaneous self-assembly to form nanosized particles in an aqueous environment. Phase transitions and scattering studies confirm that the supramolecular nanogels can be readily tailored to obtain the desired phase-transition temperature and temperature-induced release of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The resulting nanogels exhibit an extremely high load carrying capacity (up to 24.8%) and drug-entrapment stability, making the loading processes highly efficient. Importantly, in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that DOX-loaded nanogels possess excellent biosafety for drug delivery applications under physiological conditions. When the environmental temperature is increased to 40 °C, DOX-loaded nanogels trigger rapid DOX release and exert cytotoxic effects, significantly reducing the dose required compared to free DOX. Given its simplicity, low cost, high reliability, and efficiency, this newly developed temperature-responsive nanocarrier has highly promising potential for controlled release drug delivery systems. </AbstractText>

However, its properties are still confined due to the limited active sites and poor conductivity. Thus, it remains a great challenge to synergistically achieve structural and electronic modulations for MoSe2 -based HER catalysts because of the contradictory relationship between these two characteristics. Herein, bacterial cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers are used to assist the uniform growth of few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets, which effectively increase the active sites of MoSe2 for hydrogen atom adsorption. Meanwhile, carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) nanofibers provide a 3D network for electrolyte penetration into the inner space and accelerate electron transfer as well, thus leading to the dramatically increased HER activity. In acidic media, the CBC/MoSe2 hybrid catalyst exhibits fast hydrogen evolution kinetics with onset overpotential of 91 mV and Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) , which is much more outstanding than both bulk MoSe2 aggregates and CBC nanofibers. Furthermore, the fast HER kinetics are well supported by theoretical calculations of density-functional-theory analysis with a low activation barrier of 0.08 eV for H2 generation. Hence, this work highlights an efficient solution to develop high-performance HER catalysts by incorporating biotemplate materials, to simultaneously achieve increased active sites and conductivity. </AbstractText>

The droplet-guiding track with a droplet stopper is designed to manipulate the movement of a droplet on the superhydrophobic substrate. The superhydrophobic Ag dendritic substrates are fabricated through a galvanic displacement reaction and subsequent self-assembled monolayer coating. The optimal galvanic reaction time to fabricate a SERS-active Ag dendritic substrate for effective SERS detection is determined, with the optimized substrate exhibiting an enhancement factor of 6.3 × 10(5) . The height of the droplet stopper is optimized to control droplet motion, including moving and stopping. Based on the manipulation of individual droplets, the optimized droplet-based real-time SERS sensor shows high resistance to surface contaminants, and droplets containing rhodamine 6G, Nile blue A, and malachite green are successively controlled and detected without spectral interference. This noble droplet-based SERS sensor reduces sample preparation time to a few seconds and increased detection rate to 0.5 µL s(-1) through the simple operation mechanism of the sensor.

For the integration of molecular informatics into the clinical workflow, it is important to understand the computational components of the NGS workflow by which raw sequence data are transformed into clinically actionable genomic information and to address the challenges of having a robust and sustainable informatics infrastructure for NGS-based testing in a clinical environment. Adapting to needs ranging from specimen procurement to report delivery is crucial for the optimal utilization of cytology specimens to accommodate requests from clinicians to improve patient care.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze time motion characteristics of elite male handball players of the last World Championships played in Qatar in 2015. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">384 Players from 24 national teams were analyzed during 88 matches using a tracking camera system and a bespoke software (Prozone Handball V.1.2, Prozone, Leeds, UK). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The average time on court (n=2505) during the World Championships for all players was 36:48 minutes (± 20:27 min). Goalkeepers, left and right wings were on court most of the playing time (GK 43.00±25:59 min; LW 42:02±21:07 min; RW 43:44±21:37 min). The total distance covered during each game (2607.5 ± 1438.4 m) consisted mostly of walking and jogging. The cumulative distance covered during the tournament was 16313 ± 9423.3 m. Players performed 857.2 ± 445.7 activity changes with a recovery time of 124.3±143s. The average running pace was 78.2 ± 10.8 m·min(-1). There was no significant difference between high ranked and lower ranked teams in terms of distance covered in different locomotion categories. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Specific physical conditioning is necessary to maximize performance of handball players and minimize the occurrence of fatigue when performing in long tournaments. </AbstractText>

Also, we studied the relationship between the aerobic parameters from these tests and the kayakers' performances. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Twelve male elite slalom kayakers from the Brazilian National Team participated in this study. All tests were conducted using a tethered canoe system to obtain the force records. The CF was applied on four days and analyzed by hyperbolic (CFhyper) and linear (CFlin) mathematical models. The maximal lactate steady state intensity (MLSSint) was obtained by three 30-minute continuous tests. The time of a simulated race was considered as the performance index. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">No difference (P < 0.05) between CFhyper (65.9 ± 1.6 N) and MLSSint (60.3 ± 2.5 N) was observed; however, CFlin (71.1 ± 1.7 N) was higher than MLSSint.

The purpose of this study was to conduct both a gross and a more detailed temporal phase analysis of the CMJ performances of senior and academy RL players, to provide greater insight into how neuromuscular function differs between these groups. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Twenty senior and fourteen academy (under-19) male RL players performed three maximal effort CMJs on a force platform with forward dynamics subsequently employed to allow gross performance measures and entire kinetic and kinematic-time curves to be compared between groups. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Jump height (JH), reactive strength index modified, concentric displacement, and relative concentric impulse (C-IMP) were the only gross measures that were greater for senior players (d = 0.58-0.91) compared to academy RL players. The relative force- and displacement-time curves were similar between groups, but the relative power- and velocity-time curves were greater (d = 0.59-0.97) for the senior players at 94-96% and 89-100% of the total movement time, respectively. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The CMJ distinguished between senior and academy RL players, with seniors demonstrating greater JH through applying a larger C-IMP and thus achieving greater velocity throughout the majority of the concentric phase and at take-off. Therefore, academy RL players should train to improve triple (i.e. ankle, knee and hip) extension velocity during the CMJ in order to bring their jump height scores in line with those attained by senior players. </AbstractText>

Daily TL data were included in the analysis, including session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE-TL), total distance (TD), high-speed running distance (HSD; >5m·s(-1)) and high-metabolic power distance (HPD; >20 W·kg(-1)). Rolling sums were calculated, non-training days were removed and athletes corresponding injury status was marked as 'available' or 'unavailable'. Linear (generalized estimating equations; GEE) and non-linear (random forest; RF) statistical methods were adopted. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Injury risk factors varied according to positional group. For adjustables, the TL variables associated most highly with injury were 7-day TD, 7-day HPD, where for hit-up forwards was sRPE-TL ratio and 14-day TD. For outside backs, 21 and 28-day sRPE-TL were identified and for wide-running forwards sRPE-TL ratio. The individual RF models showed that the importance of the TL variables on injury incidence varied between athletes. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Differences in risk factors were recognized between positional groups and individual athletes, likely due to varied physiological capacities and physical demands. Further, these results suggest that robust machine learning techniques can appropriately monitor injury risk amongst professional team sport athletes. </AbstractText>

Whether this process has an influence on performance-related factors needs to be investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine how a short disturbance of a recovery phase is assessed and whether subsequent repeated sprint performance is affected by it. A quasi-experimental 2x2-factors cross-over design with 34 sport science undergraduate students (age 20.3 ± 2.1) was applied. Factors were the type of intervention (power nap vs. systematic breathing; between-subjects) and the experimental condition (disturbed vs. non-disturbed break; within-subjects). Repeated sprint performance was measured through 6x4 s sprint protocols (with 20 s breaks) before and after a 25 min recovery break on two test days. Subjective evaluation of the interventions was measured through the Short Recovery and Stress Scale and a manipulation check assessing whether participants experienced the recovery phase as efficacious and pleasant. Regarding the objective data, no significant difference between sprint performances in terms of average peak velocity (m/s) on the NMT was found. The manipulation check revealed that disturbed conditions were rated significantly lower than regular conditions in terms of appreciation, t(31) = 3.09, p = .01. Short disturbances of recovery do not seem to affect subsequent performance; nevertheless, participants assessed disturbed conditions more negative than regular conditions. In essence, the findings indicate a negligible role of short interruptions on an objective level. Subjectively, they affected the performance-related assessment of the participants and should be treated with caution. </AbstractText>

Modern coaches are shifting from reliance on personal memory, experience, and opinion to evidence from collected training load data. Training load monitoring may hold vital information for developing systems of monitoring that follow the training process with such precision that both performance prediction and day-to-day management of training become an adjunct to preparation and performance. Time series data collection and analyses in sport are still in their infancy with considerable efforts being applied in "big-data" analytics and models of the appropriate variables to monitor and methods for doing so. Training monitoring has already garnered important applications, but lacks a theoretical framework from which to develop further. As such, we propose a framework involving the following: analyses of individuals, trend analyses, rules-based analysis, and statistical process control. </AbstractText>

A further aim was to examine the usefulness of differential perceived exertion (dRPE) as a tool for monitoring internal ML in soccer referees. Twenty field referees (FR) and 43 assistant referees (AR) participated in this study. Data were collected from 30 competitive matches (FR = 20 observations, AR = 43 observations) and included measures of internal (Edwards' heart rate derived training impulse [TRIMPEDW]), external (total distance covered [TD], distance covered at high speeds [HSR] and player load [PL]) ML, differentiated ratings of perceived respiratory [sRPEres ML] and leg muscle [sRPEmus ML] exertion). Internal and external ML were all greater for FR when compared to AR (-19.7 to -72.5); with differences ranging from very likely very large to most likely extremely large. The relationships between internal ML and external ML indicators were, in most cases, unclear for FR (r < .35) and small to moderate for AR (r < .40). We found substantial differences between RPEres and RPEmus scores in both FR (.6 AU; ±90% confidence limits .4 AU) and AR (.4; ±.3 AU). These data demonstrate the multifaceted demands of soccer refereeing and thereby highlight the importance of monitoring both internal and external ML. Moreover, dRPE represent distinct dimensions of effort and may be useful in monitoring soccer referees ML during official matches. </AbstractText>

27918666|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Training quantification is basic to evaluate an endurance athlete's responses to the training loads, ensure adequate stress/recovery balance and determine the relationship between training and performance. Quantifying both external and internal workload is important, because the external workload does not measure the biological stress imposed by the exercise sessions. Generally used quantification methods include retrospective questionnaires, diaries, direct observation and physiological monitoring, often based on the measurement of oxygen uptake, heart rate and blood lactate concentration. Other methods in use in endurance sports include speed measurement and the measurement of power output, made possible by recent technological advances, such as power meters in cycling and triathlon. Among subjective methods of quantification the RPE stands out because of its wide use. Concurrent assessments of the various quantification methods allow researchers and practitioners to evaluate stress/recovery balance, adjust individual training programmes and determine the relationships between external load, internal load and athletes' performance. This brief review summarizes the most relevant external and internal workload quantification methods in endurance sports, and provides practical examples of their implementation to adjust the training programmes of elite athletes in accordance to their individualized stress/recovery balance. </AbstractText>

Then, the miR-224 mimics, miR-224 inhibitor, and miRNA-ShNC were transfected into mammary epithelial cells (MECs), respectively, and the expression of miR-224 and its target genes was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Furthermore, the triglyceride production and cell apoptosis were detected by triglyceride mensuration reagent kit using flow cytometry. The results showed that ACADM and ALDH2 were predicted to be the target genes of miR-224, primarily by bioinformatics analysis. We founded that miR-224 could recognize with ACADM-3'UTR and ALDH2-3'UTR, indicating that the target sites existed in 3'UTR of ACADM and ALDH2. And then, the expressions of miR-224 had negative trend with the levels of ACADM and ALDH2, suggesting that miR-224 could downregulate the expressions of ACADM and ALDH2. Finally, the triglyceride production decreased and apoptosis rate increased after the overexpression of miR-224 in MECs. The above results indicated that miR-224 regulating target genes in lipid metabolism might be used as a new pathway for better breeding. </AbstractText>

Biomechanical studies in Paralympics mainly contributed to performance enhancement by technical optimization (n=32) and/or injury prevention (n=6). Also, biomechanics was found to be important in understanding activity limitation caused by various impairments, relevant for evidence-based classification in Paralympic sports (n=6). Distinctions were made between biomechanical studies in sitting (41%), standing (38%), and swimming athletes (21%). In sitting athletes, kinematics and kinetics in wheelchair propulsion were mostly studied, mainly in spinal cord injured athletes. Also kinetics and/or kinematics in wheelchair basketball, seated discus throwing, stationary shot putting, handcycling, sit-skiing and ice sledge hockey received attention. In standing sports, kinematics of amputee athletes performing jump sports and running, and the optimization of prosthetic devices were primarily investigated. No studies were reported on other standing sports. In swimming, kick rate and resistance training were mainly studied. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Biomechanical research is important for performance by gaining insight into technical optimization, injury prevention and evidence-based classification in Paralympic sports.

Seven sub-elite male athletes were tested using pole sets of different lengths (ranging between 77 and 98% of participants' body height). Tests were conducted on a treadmill, set to a 2% incline and an approximate racing speed. Poling forces, contact times, and oxygen uptake were measured throughout the testing. Pole length was positively correlated with ground contact time (r = .57, p < .001) and negatively correlated with poling frequency (r = - .48, p = .003). Pole length was also positively correlated with pole recovery time and propulsive impulse produced per poling cycle (r = .36, p = .031; r = .35, p = .042, respectively). Oxygen uptake and pole length were negatively correlated (r = - .51, p = .004). This acute study shows that increasing pole length for double poling in sub-elite cross country skiers under the given conditions seems to change the poling mechanics in distinct ways resulting in a more efficient poling action by decreasing an athlete's metabolic cost. </AbstractText>

Thirteen participants performed ten unilateral knee extension training sessions over 5 weeks. Each limb was randomised to one of the following set configurations: traditional (4 sets of 8 repetitions at maximum intended velocity, 10RM load, 3-min pause between sets), and inter-repetition rest (32 maximum intended velocity repetitions, 10RM load, 17.4 s of rest between each repetition). Velocity of each repetition was recorded throughout the programme. Before, and after training, individual linear force-velocities were calculated, and the following parameters were obtained: force, and velocity axis intercept, slope, and estimated maximum power. Mean velocity was higher throughout the programme for inter-repetition rest configuration (0.54±0.01 vs. 0.48±0.01 m.s(-1) for inter-repetition rest, and traditional configuration respectively; main effect of set configuration: p<0.001). There was a significant increase in force and velocity intercepts, but a steeper negative slope after both training protocols (main effect of time: p<0.001 for every variable). Differences in resistance training velocity did not affect the adaptations. Our results suggest that in a short-term programme maximum intended rather than actual velocity is a key factor to modulate strength adaptations. </AbstractText>

Fourteen female subjects participated (age: 18.8±1.1 years, height: 163.2±8.1 cm, weight 63.0±7.9 kg). Sagittal plane trunk, hip, and knee biomechanics were calculated during the landing and take-off phases of DVJ with different goal conditions. Repeated measures ANOVAs determined differences between goal conditions. Vertical jump height displacement was not different during VOG compared to POG. Greater hip extensor moment (p<0.001*) and hip angular impulse (p<0.004*) were found during VOG compared to POG. Subjects landed more erect with less magnitude of trunk flexion (p=0.002*) during POG compared to VOG. A virtual target can optimize jump height and promote increased hip moments and trunk flexion.

Ballistic dynamic tasks have the benefit of eliciting maximum EMG signals for normalization, despite having the potential for greater signal variability. It is the purpose of this study to compare maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) to non-isometric tasks with increasing degrees of extrinsic variability, i.e., joint range of motion, velocity, rate of contraction, etc., to determine if the ballistic tasks, which elicit larger peak EMG signals, are more reliable than the constrained MVIC. Fifteen subjects performed MVIC, isokinetic, maximum counter-movement jump, and sprint tasks while EMG was collected from nine muscles in the quadriceps, hamstrings, and lower leg. The results revealed the unconstrained ballistic tasks were more reliable compared to the constrained MVIC and isokinetic tasks for all triceps surae muscles. The EMG from sprinting was more reliable than the constrained cases for both the hamstrings and vasti. The most reliable EMG signals occurred when the body was permitted its natural, unconstrained motion. These results suggest that EMG is best normalized using ballistic tasks to provide the greatest within-subject reliability, which beneficially yield maximum EMG values. </AbstractText>

To do this, 96 steps from 12 different runs at speeds ranging from 2.77-5.55 m·s-1 were recorded simultaneously with Runmatic as well as with an opto-electronic device installed on a motorized treadmill to measure the contact and aerial time of each step. Additionally, several running mechanics variables were calculated using the contact and aerial times measured and previously validated equations. Several statistics were computed to test the validity and reliability of Runmatic in comparison with the opto-electronic device for the measurement of contact time, aerial time, vertical oscillation, leg stiffness, maximum relative force, and step frequency. The running mechanics values obtained with both the app and the opto-electronic device showed a high degree of correlation (r = 0.94-0.99, p<0.001). Moreover, there was very close agreement between instruments as revealed by the ICC (2,1) (ICC = 0.965-0.991). Finally, both Runmatic and the opto-electronic device showed almost identical reliability levels when measuring each set of 8 steps for every run recorded.

Three-dimensional joint kinematics were simultaneously recorded by an optical motion capture system and an IMU system with six sensors placed on the head, chest, and bilateral upper and lower arms. The sensor-to-segment axes alignment was accomplished manually. The IMU neck and trunk IMU flexion/extension angles were accurate to within 2.9±0.9 degrees and 1.6±1.1 degrees, respectively. The IMU shoulder elevation measure was accurate to within 6.8±2.7 degrees and the elbow flexion measure was accurate to within 8.2±2.8 degrees. In the Bland-Altman analyses, there were no significant systematic errors present; however, there was a significant inversely proportional error across all joints. As the gold standard measurement increased, the IMU underestimated the magnitude of the joint angle.

Reduced coefficient of friction may explain recent reports of fine motor dysfunction in diabetic patients. Coefficient of friction was evaluated using slip force evaluation in a cross-sectional cohort of diabetic patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Covariates of tactile sensation, disease duration, glycated hemoglobin, and clinical diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy were also assessed. A significant decrease in fingertip coefficient of friction in the diabetic group was found as compared to controls. Health state covariates did not alter the strength of between-group differences in statistical analyses. This finding of between group differences for fingertip frictional properties suggests that causative factors of reported manual motor dysfunction lie in both the distal and proximal portions of the nervous system. </AbstractText>

In this study, the relative osteokinematic Cardan joint angles of the hip and knee were calculated using the Kinect 2.0 skeletal tracker. The pelvis segments of the default skeletal model were reoriented and three-dimensional joint angles were compared to a marker-based system during a drop vertical jump and a hip abduction motion. Good agreement between the Kinect and marker based system were found for knee (correlation coefficient = 0.96, cycle RMS error = 11°, peak flexion difference = 3°) and hip (correlation coefficient = 0.97, cycle RMS = 12°, peak flexion difference = 12°) flexion during the landing phase of the drop vertical jump and for hip abduction/adduction (correlation coefficient = 0.99, cycle RMS error = 7°, peak flexion difference = 8°) during isolated hip motion. Non-sagittal hip and knee angles did not correlate well for the drop vertical jump. When limited to activities in the optimal capture volume and with simple modifications to the skeletal model, the Kinect 2.0 skeletal tracker can provide limited three-dimensional kinematic information of the lower limbs that may be useful for functional movement assessment. </AbstractText>

Participants were randomly assigned to either WBVT (n=13) or non-exercising control group (n=14). HRV and body composition were measured before and after 6 weeks. There was a significant group x time interaction (P<0.05) for heart rate, sympathovagal balance and body fat percentage (BF%) such that all significantly decreased (P<0.05); and R-R intervals which significant increased (P<0.05) following WBVT compared to no changes after control. The changes in sympathovagal balance were correlated with changes in BF% (r=0.63, P<0.05). Our findings indicate that WBVT improves HRV and BF% in obese Hispanic postmenopausal women. The improvement in BF% partially explained the decrease in sympathovagal balance.

27918706|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Heart rate (HR) is a periodic activity that is variable over time due to intrinsic cardiac factors and extrinsic neural control, largely by the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability (HRV) is analyzed by measuring consecutive beat-to-beat intervals. This variability can contain information about the factors regulating cardiac activity under normal and pathological conditions, but the information obtained from such analyses is not yet fully understood. In this article, HRV in zebrafish larvae was evaluated under normal conditions and under the effect of substances that modify intrinsic cardiac activity and cardiac activity modulated by the nervous system. We found that the factors affecting intrinsic activity have negative chronotropic and arrhythmogenic effects at this stage of development, whereas neural modulatory factors have a lesser impact. The results suggest that cardiac activity largely depends on the intrinsic properties of the heart tissue in the early stages of development and, to a lesser extent, in the maturing nervous system. We also report, for the first time, the influence of the neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid on HRV. The results demonstrate the larval zebrafish model as a useful tool in the study of intrinsic cardiac activity and its role in heart diseases. </AbstractText>

Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study measured the performance of digital screening mammography interpreted by 359 radiologists across 95 facilities in six Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. The study included 1 682 504 digital screening mammograms performed between 2007 and 2013 in 792 808 women. Performance measures were calculated according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 5th edition, and were compared with published benchmarks by the BCSC, the National Mammography Database, and performance recommendations by expert opinion. Benchmarks were derived from the distribution of performance metrics across radiologists and were presented as 50th (median), 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, with graphic presentations using smoothed curves. Results Mean screening performance measures were as follows: abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), 11.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.5, 11.6); cancers detected per 1000 screens, or cancer detection rate (CDR), 5.1 (95% CI: 5.0, 5.2); sensitivity, 86.9% (95% CI: 86.3%, 87.6%); specificity, 88.9% (95% CI: 88.8%, 88.9%); false-negative rate per 1000 screens, 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8); positive predictive value (PPV) 1, 4.4% (95% CI: 4.3%, 4.5%); PPV2, 25.6% (95% CI: 25.1%, 26.1%); PPV3, 28.6% (95% CI: 28.0%, 29.3%); cancers stage 0 or 1, 76.9%; minimal cancers, 57.7%; and node-negative invasive cancers, 79.4%. Recommended CDRs were achieved by 92.1% of radiologists in community practice, and 97.1% achieved recommended ranges for sensitivity. Only 59.0% of radiologists achieved recommended AIRs, and only 63.0% achieved recommended levels of specificity. Conclusion The majority of radiologists in the BCSC surpass cancer detection recommendations for screening mammography; however, AIRs continue to be higher than the recommended rate for almost half of radiologists interpreting screening mammograms.

Materials and Methods This prospective study received institutional review board approval and fully complied with HIPAA regulations for patient data. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A nonlinear finite element analysis method was developed to estimate mechanical parameters that relate to hip fracture resistance by using MR images. Twenty-three women (mean age ± standard deviation, 61.7 years ± 13.8) were recruited from a single osteoporosis center. To thoroughly assess the reproducibility of the finite element method, three separate analyses were performed: a test-retest reproducibility analysis, where each of the first 13 subjects underwent MR imaging on three separate occasions to determine longitudinal variability, and an intra- and interoperator reproducibility analysis, where a single examination was performed in each of the next 10 subjects and four operators independently performed the analysis two times in each of the subjects. Reproducibility of parameters that reflect fracture resistance was assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the coefficient of variation. Results For test-retest reproducibility analysis and inter- and intraoperator analyses for proximal femur stiffness, yield strain, yield load, ultimate strain, ultimate load, resilience, and toughness in both stance and sideways-fall loading configurations each had an individual median coefficient of variation of less than 10%. Additionally, all measures had an intraclass correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. Conclusion This experiment demonstrates that the finite element analysis model can consistently and reliably provide fracture risk information on correctly segmented bone images.

Materials and Methods A custom-made colon phantom was filled with nonionic iodine-based contrast material, and a gadolinium-filled capsule representing a contrast material-enhanced polyp was positioned on the colon wall. The colon phantom was scanned with a preclinical spectral photon-counting CT system to obtain spectral and conventional data. By fully using the multibin spectral information, material decomposition was performed to generate iodine and gadolinium maps. Quantitative measurements were performed within the lumen and polyp to quantitatively determine the absolute content of iodine and gadolinium. Results In a conventional CT section, absorption values of both contrast agents were similar at approximately 110 HU. Contrast material maps clearly differentiated the distributions, with gadolinium solely in the polyp and iodine in the lumen of the colon. Quantitative measurements of contrast material concentrations in the colon and polyp matched well with those of actual prepared mixtures. Conclusion Dual-contrast spectral photon-counting CT colonography with iodine-filled lumen and gadolinium-tagged polyps may enable ready differentiation between polyps and tagged fecal material.

Cotinine is an easily detectable metabolite of nicotine and, therefore, can be used as an objective surrogate marker for smoking status. We measured cotinine levels in NAb-positive and NAb-negative patients to find a potential association of nicotine consumption and NAb development. Cotinine was measured in 37 patients with known smoking status and in 123 patients with unknown smoking status, all of whom were routinely tested for NAb. Cotinine was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, inhibition assay. We compared cotinine levels by NAb status and tested for the strength of association between cotinine and NAb status. We found a discrepancy between smoking status stated by patients and status defined by cotinine levels in 7 of 37 patients. In both cohorts, together with and without previously known smoking status (n?=?160), we found 34% and 39% smokers, respectively, as defined by cotinine levels in NAb-negative and NAb-positive patients (P?=?0.511). In our analysis, smoking was not associated with higher risk of NAb development. Moreover, smoking habits stated by patients do not always correlate with cotinine levels. </AbstractText>

Information on the value of this program for its cost is now called for. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the cost-utility of the SC program compared with care-as-usual (CAU) in patients with head and neck cancer or lung cancer who have psychological distress. Patients and Methods In total, 156 patients were randomly assigned to SC or CAU. Intervention costs, direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, productivity losses, and health-related quality-of-life data during the intervention or control period and 12 months of follow-up were calculated by using Trimbos and Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry, Productivity and Disease Questionnaire, and EuroQol-5 Dimension measures and data from the hospital information system. The SC program's value for the cost was investigated by comparing mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results After imputation of missing data, mean cumulative costs were -3,950 (95% CI, -8,158 to -190) lower, and mean number of QALYs was 0.116 (95% CI, 0.005 to 0.227) higher in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention group had a probability of 96% that cumulative QALYs were higher and cumulative costs were lower than in the control group. Four additional analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of this finding, and they found that the intervention group had a probability of 84% to 98% that cumulative QALYs were higher and a probability of 91% to 99% that costs were lower than in the control group. Conclusion SC is highly likely to be cost-effective; the number of QALYs was higher and cumulative costs were lower for SC compared with CAU. </AbstractText>

Aberrant mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) expression has been reported in glioblastoma and may contribute to bevacizumab resistance. The phase II study GO27819 investigated the monovalent MET inhibitor onartuzumab plus bevacizumab (Ona + Bev) versus placebo plus bevacizumab (Pla + Bev) in recurrent glioblastoma. Methods At first recurrence after chemoradiation, bevacizumab-naïve patients with glioblastoma were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive Ona (15 mg/kg, once every 3 weeks) + Bev (15 mg/kg, once every 3 weeks) or Pla + Bev until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival by response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, and safety. Exploratory biomarker analyses correlated efficacy with expression levels of MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation, and glioblastoma subtype. Results Among 129 patients enrolled (Ona + Bev, n = 64; Pla + Bev, n = 65), baseline characteristics were balanced. The median progression-free survival was 3.9 months for Ona + Bev versus 2.9 months for Pla + Bev (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.56; P = .7444). The median overall survival was 8.8 months for Ona + Bev and 12.6 months for Pla + Bev (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.37; P = .1389). Grade ? 3 adverse events were reported in 38.5% of patients who received Ona + Bev and 35.9% of patients who received Pla + Bev. Exploratory biomarker analyses suggested that patients with high expression of hepatocyte growth factor or unmethylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase may benefit from Ona + Bev. Conclusion There was no evidence of further clinical benefit with the addition of onartuzumab to bevacizumab compared with bevacizumab plus placebo in unselected patients with recurrent glioblastoma in this phase II study; however, further investigation into biomarker subgroups is warranted. </AbstractText>

The individual patient data from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharynx Carcinoma database were used to compare all available treatments. Methods All randomized trials of radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy in nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were considered. Overall, 20 trials and 5,144 patients were included. Treatments were grouped into seven categories: RT alone (RT), IC followed by RT (IC-RT), RT followed by AC (RT-AC), IC followed by RT followed by AC (IC-RT-AC), concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), IC followed by CRT (IC-CRT), and CRT followed by AC (CRT-AC). P-score was used to rank the treatments. Fixed- and random-effects frequentist network meta-analysis models were applied. Results The three treatments with the highest probability of benefit on overall survival (OS) were CRT-AC, followed by CRT and IC-CRT, with respective hazard ratios (HRs [95% CIs]) compared with RT alone of 0.65 (0.56 to 0.75), 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92), and 0.81 (0.63 to 1.04). HRs (95% CIs) of CRT-AC compared with CRT for OS, progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control, and distant control (DC) were, respectively, 0.85 (0.68 to 1.05), 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98), 0.70 (0.48 to 1.02), and 0.87 (0.61 to 1.25). IC-CRT ranked second for PFS and the best for DC. CRT never ranked first. HRs of CRT compared with IC-CRT for OS, PFS, locoregional control, and DC were, respectively, 0.95 (0.72 to 1.25), 1.13 (0.88 to 1.46), 1.05 (0.70 to 1.59), and 1.55 (0.94 to 2.56). Regimens with more chemotherapy were associated with increased risk of acute toxicity. Conclusion The addition of AC to CRT achieved the highest survival benefit and consistent improvement for all end points. The addition of IC to CRT achieved the highest effect on DC. </AbstractText>

This placebo-controlled phase III study evaluated telotristat ethyl in this setting. Patients and Methods Patients (N = 135) experiencing four or more BMs per day despite stable-dose somatostatin analog therapy received (1:1:1) placebo, telotristat ethyl 250 mg, or telotristat ethyl 500 mg three times per day orally during a 12-week double-blind treatment period. The primary end point was change from baseline in BM frequency. In an open-label extension, 115 patients subsequently received telotristat ethyl 500 mg. Results Estimated differences in BM frequency per day versus placebo averaged over 12 weeks were -0.81 for telotristat ethyl 250 mg ( P < .001) and ?0.69 for telotristat ethyl 500 mg ( P < .001). At week 12, mean BM frequency reductions per day for placebo, telotristat ethyl 250 mg, and telotristat ethyl 500 mg were -0.9, -1.7, and -2.1, respectively. Responses, predefined as a BM frequency reduction ? 30% from baseline for ? 50% of the double-blind treatment period, were observed in 20%, 44%, and 42% of patients given placebo, telotristat ethyl 250 mg, and telotristat ethyl 500 mg, respectively. Both telotristat ethyl dosages significantly reduced mean urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid versus placebo at week 12 ( P < .001). Mild nausea and asymptomatic increases in gamma-glutamyl transferase were observed in some patients receiving telotristat ethyl. Follow-up of patients during the open-label extension revealed no new safety signals and suggested sustained BM responses to treatment. Conclusion Among patients with carcinoid syndrome not adequately controlled by somatostatin analogs, treatment with telotristat ethyl was generally safe and well tolerated and resulted in significant reductions in BM frequency and urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid. </AbstractText>

The purpose of this effort was to develop recommendations for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult-onset cancers. Methods Recommendations were developed by an expert panel with multidisciplinary representation using a systematic review (1996 to 2016) of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, observational studies, and clinical experience. Study quality was assessed using established methods, per study design. The guideline recommendations were crafted in part using the Guidelines Into Decision Support methodology. Results A total of 104 studies met eligibility criteria and compose the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. The strength of the recommendations in these guidelines is based on the quality, amount, and consistency of the evidence and the balance between benefits and harms. Recommendations It is important for health care providers to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for cardiac dysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is sufficiently high before beginning therapy. Certain higher risk populations of survivors of cancer may benefit from prevention and screening strategies implemented during cancer-directed therapies. Clinical suspicion for cardiac disease should be high and threshold for cardiac evaluation should be low in any survivor who has received potentially cardiotoxic therapy.

The Society for Reproductive Biology (SRB) 2016 conference held on the Gold Coast (Qld, Australia) displayed the current breadth of reproductive research in Australia and New Zealand, with additional insights from world leaders in the field. This conference review provides a focused summary of the key questions, emerging ideas and novel technologies that were presented in the symposia. Presented research demonstrated key advances in how stem cell biology may allow us to better understand pluripotency, as well as how environmental and lifestyle factors, such as circadian disruption, smoking, alcohol and diet, affect gametogenesis, embryo implantation, placental function and reproductive capacity. Sessions also highlighted the role of reproductive biology in providing insight into the mechanisms and processes governing a wide range of biological science disciplines, including cancer research and therapies, oncofertility, conservation of native species and chronic non-communicable diseases. Recurring themes included the importance of male and female gamete quality for reproductive potential and the critical and varied roles of the placenta in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. Dysregulation of reproductive processes can contribute to a variety of pathological states that affect future health, fertility and fecundity. Research being conducted by the SRB has the potential to shape not only the fertility of the current generation, but also the health and reproductive viability of future generations. </AbstractText>

27918728|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">In the rabbit reproductive model, maternal experimentally induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (expIDD) leads to accumulation of lipid droplets in blastocysts. Cholesterol metabolism is a likely candidate to explain such metabolic changes. Therefore, in the present study we analysed maternal and embryonic cholesterol concentrations and expression of related genes in vivo (diabetic model) and in vitro (embryo culture in hyperglycaemic medium). In pregnant expIDD rabbits, the serum composition of lipoprotein subfractions was changed, with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increase in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; in uterine fluid, total cholesterol concentrations were elevated. Expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2), insulin-induced gene-1 (INSIG1) and cholesterol 7?-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA was decreased in the liver and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of diabetic rabbits. In embryos from diabetic rabbits, the mean (±s.e.m.) ratio of cholesterol concentrations in trophoblasts to embryoblasts was changed from 1.27±2.34 (control) to 0.88±3.85 (expIDD). Rabbit blastocysts expressed HMGCR, LDLR, VLDLR, SREBF2 and INSIG1 but not CYP7A1, without any impairment of expression as a result of maternal diabetes. In vitro hyperglycaemia decreased embryonic HMGCR and SREBF2 transcription in rabbit blastocysts. The findings of the present study show that a diabetic pregnancy leads to distinct changes in maternal cholesterol metabolism with a minor effect on embryo cholesterol metabolism. </AbstractText>

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of IL-4 in induction of ?5 integrin expression in the peripheral blood samples of patients with giant cell granuloma. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIAL AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood samples of patients with central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) and healthy controls using human Monocyte Isolation Kit II. Isolated monocytes were then cultured in the absence or presence of IL-4 (10 and 20 ng/mL), and following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, Real-time PCR was performed to determine the level of ?5 integrin expression. The formation of CGCGs and morphological analyses were done under light microscopy. For confirmation of CGCGs, immunocytochemistry technique was also carried out by anti-RANK (receptor-activator of NF-?B ligand) antibody. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In both patient and control groups, ?5 levels were significantly enhanced by increasing the IL-4 dose from 10 to 20 ng/mL. In addition, these differences were significant between patient and control groups without IL-4 treatment. On the other hand, the number of cells which expressed RANK and therefore the number of giant cells were significantly higher in the patient group in comparison to controls, as assessed by immunohistochemistry evaluations. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this study, we showed an elevation in the expression levels of ?5 integrin when stimulated by IL-4.

Severe HPV infections characterize the wart, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis (WHIM) immunodeficiency syndrome, which is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the CXCR4 receptor for the CXCL12 chemokine, one of which is CXCR41013. We investigated whether CXCR41013 interferes in the HPV18 life cycle in epithelial organotypic cultures. Expression of CXCR41013 promoted stabilization of HPV oncoproteins, thus disturbing cell cycle progression and proliferation at the expense of the ordered expression of the viral genes required for virus production. Conversely, blocking CXCR41013 function restored virus production and limited HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Thus, CXCR4 and its potential activation by genetic alterations in the course of the carcinogenic process can be considered as an important host factor for HPV carcinogenesis. </AbstractText>

To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility.

Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523?000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="Conclusion and Relevance" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet. </AbstractText>

Studying the temporal dynamics of an aftereffect can help us to understand the neural processes that underlie perception, and how they change with experience. Little is known about the temporal dynamics of the expression aftereffect. We conducted two experiments to measure the timecourse of this aftereffect. In Experiment 1 we examined how the size of the aftereffect varies with changes in the duration of the adaptor and test stimuli. We found that the expression aftereffect follows the classic timecourse pattern of logarithmic build-up and exponential decay that has been demonstrated for many lower level aftereffects, as well as for facial identity and figural face aftereffects. This classic timecourse pattern suggests that the adaptive calibration mechanisms of facial expression are similar to those of lower level visual stimuli, and is consistent with a perceptual locus for the adaptation aftereffect. We also found that aftereffects could be generated by as little as 1 s of adaptation, and in some conditions lasted for as long as 3200 ms. We extended this last finding in Experiment 2, exploring the longevity of the expression aftereffect by adding a stimulus-free gap of varying duration between adaptation and test. We found that significant expression aftereffects were still present 32 s after adaptation. The persistence of the expression aftereffect suggests that they may have a considerable impact on day-to-day expression perception. </AbstractText>

Recently, the cell nucleus has been identified as a mechano-responsive organelle that contributes to the perception and response to mechanical stimuli. However, the specific mechanotransduction mechanisms that mediate these effects have not been clearly defined. Here, we review the evidence supporting (and refuting) three hypothetical nuclear mechanotransduction mechanisms: physical reorganization of chromatin, signaling at the nuclear envelope, and altered cytoskeletal structure/tension due to nuclear remodeling. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the role that mathematical models of cell mechanics can play in testing these hypotheses and elucidating how biophysical stimulation of the nucleus drives changes in cell behavior. While force-induced alterations in signaling pathways located at the nuclear envelope appear to be the most clearly supported mechanism of nuclear mechanotransduction, additional work is required to examine this process in detail and to test the impact of alternative mechanisms. The combination of sophisticated experimental techniques and advanced mathematical models are necessary to enhance our understanding of the role of the cell nucleus in mechanotransduction and, importantly, in numerous critical cell functions. </AbstractText>

Spontaneous retinal waves are the major neural activity during retinal development. Thus restoring the developmental environment by providing the proper neural activity may be able to help axon regeneration of RGCs. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Retinal explants from P5 and P11 C57BL/6 mice were treated pharmacologically or stimulated electrically, and cultured with or without brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on coverslips or a multielectrode array for 5 days to examine the neurite outgrowth capacity of RGCs. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Here we have demonstrated that neurite outgrowth of retinal explants was not affected when acetylcholine transmission was blocked pharmacologically in retinas that normally display stage II retinal waves. However, short-term induction of globally correlated neural activity at 1- to 2-minute intervals in retinas that normally display stage III retinal waves by blocking inhibitory neural transmission was found to greatly promote neurite outgrowth even in the absence of exogenous neurotrophic factors. Moreover, short-term electrical stimulation with a temporal pattern of 1- to 2-minute intervals rather than simply increasing the neural activity greatly enhanced neurite outgrowth of retinal explants of the same age. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">These results suggest that short-term alteration of neural activity with a specific temporal pattern in retinas of later developmental stages is sufficient to enhance neurite outgrowth of retinal explants.

Researchers have examined these biases in order to throw light on the nature of the self. We review this evidence in memory, face recognition, and simple perceptual matching tasks through objective measures of self-biases. We argue that the self serves as a stable anchor across different forms of judgment and that referring a stimulus to ourselves enhances the binding of stimulus features at different stages of processing (e.g., in perception and in memory) and also the binding between processing stages. There is neural evidence that self-biases reflect an underlying neural network that interacts with but is independent of attentional control networks in the brain, and that damage to the self-related network disrupts the bias effects.

We define code2brain (C2B) interfaces as maps in compilers and brains between meaning and naming syntax, which help to understand executable code. While working toward an Evolvix syntax for general-purpose programming that makes accurate modeling easy for biologists, we observed how names affect C2B quality. To protect learning and coding investments, C2B interfaces require long-term backward compatibility and semantic reproducibility (accurate reproduction of computational meaning from coder-brains to reader-brains by code alone). Semantic reproducibility is often assumed until confusing synonyms degrade modeling in biology to deciphering exercises. We highlight empirical naming priorities from diverse individuals and roles of names in different modes of computing to show how naming easily becomes impossibly difficult. We present the Evolvix BEST (Brief, Explicit, Summarizing, Technical) Names concept for reducing naming priority conflicts, test it on a real challenge by naming subfolders for the Project Organization Stabilizing Tool system, and provide naming questionnaires designed to facilitate C2B debugging by improving names used as keywords in a stabilizing programming language.

In absolute terms, there has been a more than fourfold increase in pulse trade, compared with an only 1.5-fold increase for cereals. To meet the export demand, pulse production diversified, with developed countries emerging as the main exporters while developing countries were the main importers. The exceptions were Southeastern Asia (Myanmar) and Eastern Africa, which also emerged as important exporters. Projections using an International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade indicate that the demand for pulses will continue to grow in the short-to-medium term in developing counties owing to growing population, rising per capita incomes among the lower-income groups, and increasing demand for snack/processed foods due to growing urbanization. </AbstractText>

Recently, the effectiveness of PAs has been questioned, and assessing how effective they are in enabling the future persistence of biodiversity is not trivial. Here, we focus on terrestrial PAs and clarify the terminology related to PA effectiveness, distinguishing between management and ecological aspects. We suggest that the quality of governance affects both aspects of effectiveness but recognize a lack of synthetic understanding of the topic. We present a conceptual framework linking the underlying mechanisms by which the quality of governance affects conservation outcomes in PAs and how this relates to conservation planning. We show that it is crucial to separate pressure and response and how these together will lead to the observed conservation outcomes. We urge for more focused attention on governance factors and in particular more empirical research on how to address causality and how to account for the quality of governance when prioritizing actions. Our framework is linked to the classic concepts of systematic conservation planning and clarifies the strategies available to achieve a comprehensive and effective network of PAs. </AbstractText>

The current practice for diagnosing CMV pneumonitis in this setting is based on interpretation of clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. There is a need for a sensitive and specific laboratory test to objectively distinguish between patients with CMV pneumonitis and those with CMV infection, and non-CMV pneumonia. In this study, we compared plasma and non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (NBBAL) CMV viral loads in patients with CMV pneumonitis and those with CMV infection and non-CMV pneumonia. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to establish a threshold and assess utility of viral loads in the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis. We assessed the urea dilution method, and expression of viral loads relative to the total amount of extracted nucleic acids in correcting for NBBAL dilution. CMV quantification in NBBAL specimens was more predictive of CMV pneumonitis than blood CMV quantification. The threshold of 4.03 log IU/ml in NBBAL specimens has good predictive value and can be used to guide management of infants with suspected CMV pneumonitis. Adjusting for dilution of NBBAL specimens by using the urea dilution method or by expressing the viral load relative to the total nucleic acids extracted did not provide additional analytical benefits.

Fifty-seven high-functioning children (48 male, 9 female), ages 7-12 years with autism spectrum disorder participated in this study. The 5-week summerMAX treatment included instruction and therapeutic activities targeting social/social-communication skills, interpretation of nonliteral language skills, face-emotion recognition skills, and interest expansion. A behavioral program was also used to increase skills acquisition and decrease autism spectrum disorder symptoms and problem behaviors. Feasibility was supported via high levels of fidelity and parent, child, and staff clinician satisfaction. Significant treatment effects favoring the treatment group over waitlist controls were found on all 5 of the primary outcome measures (i.e., child test of nonliteral language skills and parent ratings of the children's autism spectrum disorder symptoms, targeted social/social-communication skills, broader social performance, and withdrawal). Staff clinician ratings substantiated the improvements reported by parents. Results of this randomized clinical trial are consistent with those of prior studies of summerMAX and suggest that the program was feasible and effective when implemented by a community agency under real-world conditions. </AbstractText>

Collaboration between the correctional services (CS) and mental health services (MHS) is required to address this. Little is known of the collaborative processes in this context, however. This article presents the findings of a study exploring the characteristics of collaborative practices between the MHS and CS in a Norwegian context. A purposeful sample (n = 12) of MHS and CS leaders was recruited from one region in Norway. Taking a generic qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews with each participant explored specific structures that promoted collaboration, the nature of collaborative relationships, and factors that facilitated or constrained these. The study indicated that leaders are exercised by one dimension of collaborative practice in particular, namely the distribution of responsibility for the care of the offender across systems. This activity is mediated by highly complex external structures as well as the individual characteristics of the professionals involved. They speculate that professionals and organisations who fail to take responsibility for the offender as expected may be constrained from doing so by resource limitations, logistical issues, and poor attitudes towards the offender population. Based on these findings, this study suggests that the MHS and CS workforce would benefit from a great knowledgeability of the roles and responsibility domains of collaborative practice. Improving competence in the workforce in this area would achieve this. However, competency frameworks that address this domain are currently limited. Recommendations on how to extend the remit of this domain in light of the current findings are provided. </AbstractText>

Cucurbita ficifolia extract was administered daily by gavage to lean and MSG-obese mice for 30 days. At the end of treatment, cytokine mRNA expression in adipose tissue was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the protein levels of these cytokines were also quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cucurbita ficifolia extract decreased body mass and inflammation in MSG-obese mice by reducing the expression of TNF-? and IL-6; these decreases were parallel to significant reductions in protein levels. The extract also increased protein levels of IL-10 in lean mice and IFN-? in both lean and MSG-obese mice. In conclusion, C. ficifolia extract modulates systemic chronic inflammation in MSG-obese mice and could have a beneficial effect on the adaptive immune system in obesity. </AbstractText>

Hepatitis B virus in individuals further increases the risk of HCC. The two risk factors are prevalent in rural Kenya and continuously predispose the rural populations to HCC. A quantitative cancer risk assessment therefore quantified the levels at which potential pre- and postharvest interventions reduce the HCC risk attributable to consumption of contaminated maize and groundnuts. The assessment applied a probabilistic model to derive probability distributions of HCC cases and percentage reductions levels of the risk from secondary data. Contaminated maize and groundnuts contributed to 1,847 ± 514 and 158 ± 52 HCC cases per annum, respectively. The total contribution of both foods to the risk was additive as it resulted in 2,000 ± 518 cases per annum. Consumption and contamination levels contributed significantly to the risk whereby lower age groups were most affected. Nonetheless, pre- and postharvest interventions might reduce the risk by 23.0-83.4% and 4.8-95.1%, respectively. Therefore, chronic exposure to aflatoxins increases the HCC risk in rural Kenya, but a significant reduction of the risk can be achieved by applying specific pre- and postharvest interventions. </AbstractText>

We examined if the levels of various markers of breast cancer risk and inflammation, as well as the effects of soy food consumption on these markers, differ between Asian and non-Asian premenopausal women in two soy intervention trials. One study randomized 220 women to a 2-yr intervention and the other one randomized 96 women in a crossover design to examine the effects of consumption of 2 daily soy servings on nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) volume; estrogens in serum, NAF, and urine; insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 3, and inflammatory markers in serum; and mammographic densities. Mixed linear models were applied to assess ethnic differences in biomarkers and response to the soy diet. Serum C-reactive protein, serum leptin, NAF volume, and NAF estrone sulfate were lower, while urinary isoflavones were higher in Asian than in non-Asian women. A significant interaction (pinteraction = 0.05) between ethnicity and soy diet was observed for IGF-1 but not for other biomarkers. The current findings suggest possible ethnic differences in levels of biomarkers for breast cancer risk but little evidence that Asian women respond differently to soy foods than non-Asian women. </AbstractText>

The knowledge gained from such an assessment can be applied towards communication contexts that aim to promote children's health literacy and their well-being. With increased health literacy, children can actively participate in decision-making regarding their own health and can understand why healthy behaviors are important to adult health (Borzekowski, 2009). The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the understudied intersection between health literacy and health conceptualizations in children in order to elaborate on health literacy theory. Specifically, the findings contribute to health communication between children and their caregivers, and between children and health care providers. Qualitative, in depth interviews were conducted with elementary school children. The significance of the study is its contribution to health communication for children, where interventions can consider health literacy types and levels before addressing children's health outcomes. Findings show how we can understand children's conceptualizations and can address health literacy skills inside and out of the classroom in ways that resonate with children. </AbstractText>

To accomplish this goal, faculty at Case Western Reserve University, Ohio, USA, used the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) framework to create, improve, and sustain a community-based interprofessional learning activity for large numbers of medical students (N = 177) and nursing students (N = 154). The model guided the process and included identification of context-specific barriers and facilitators, continual monitoring and improvement using data, and evaluation of student learning outcomes as well as programme outcomes. First year Case Western Reserve University medical students and undergraduate nursing students participated in team-structured prevention screening clinics in the Cleveland Metropolitan Public School District. Identification of barriers and facilitators assisted with overcoming logistic and scheduling issues, large class size, differing ages and skill levels of students and creating sustainability. Continual monitoring led to three distinct phases of improvement and resulted in the creation of an authentic team structure, role clarification, and relevance for students. Evaluation of student learning included both qualitative and quantitative methods, resulting in statistically significant findings and qualitative themes of learner outcomes. The OMRU implementation model provided a useful framework for successful implementation resulting in a sustainable interprofessional learning activity. </AbstractText>

Effective interprofessional teamwork calls on good collaboration between professionals and patients, coordination between professionals, and the development of teamwork over time. Effective development of teams also requires support from the wider organisational context. In a Dutch village, healthcare professionals work closely together, and mutual consultations as well as interprofessional meetings take place on a regular basis. The network was created as a precondition for sustainable interprofessional teamwork in elderly care. However, several external barriers were experienced regarding the supportive structure and cooperative attitude of the healthcare insurer and municipality. The aim of the article is to examine these experience-based issues regarding internal organisation, perspective, and definition of effective teamwork. Complicating factors refer to finding the right key figures, and the different perspectives on team development and team effectiveness. Our conclusion is that the organisation of healthcare insurance companies needs to implement fundamental changes to facilitate an interprofessional care approach. Furthermore, municipalities should work on their vision of the needs and benefits of a fruitful collaboration with interprofessional healthcare teams. The challenge for healthcare teams is to learn to speak the language of external partners. To support the development of interprofessional teams, external parties need to recognise and trust in a shared aim to provide quality of care in an efficient and effective way. </AbstractText>

Various databases were searched for English articles from 2000 - 2014. Twelve articles met the selection criteria. We found that interventions involving cognitive behavioural therapy, infant stimulation, and problem solving can improve outcomes for PND. Challenges to implementation included: dependence on specific cadres of health workers; motivation and capacity of delivery agents for additional responsibilities; high level of supervision required; and lack of structures and mechanisms to ensure fidelity. Recommendations are proposed that can potentially assist future efforts at addressing PND in women especially in developing countries.

The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate sport psychology consultants' (SPCs') views and experiences of an interprofessional team approach to sport injury rehabilitation. A cross-sectional online survey previously used with athletic trainers was distributed via a US-based sport/exercise psychology list-serve (N = 1245). A total of 62 (27 men, 35 women, M age 38.2 years, age range: 22-73 years) participants with 10.6 (SD = 9.8) years of experience as an SPC were included in the final analyses. On average, SPCs felt that it was very important (M = 6.6; SD = 0.6) for athletes to have access to an interprofessional care team. Of the sample, 64.5% (n = 40) typically worked as part of an interprofessional care team 44.7% of the time. The SPCs (n = 28; 45.2%) also indicated that the primary treatment providers (e.g., athletic trainer, physical therapist) were typically serving as the primary point person for such teams. Since gaining entry to sport medicine can be an area SPCs struggle with, building effective working relationships with treatment providers can help promote and increase SPCs involvement in providing holistic, interprofessional care to athletes with injuries. To ensure athletes' successful biopsychosocial return to sport, different individuals and professionals should work together for the benefit of the athlete by adopting holistic care during sports injury rehabilitation. </AbstractText>

Despite earlier studies with its metabolites (3-morpholino-syndnonimine (SIN-1) and N-nitroso-N-morpholino-amino-acetonitrile (SIN-1A)), which indicated a potential favorable cardioprotective activity, a lot of controversy remains. The aim of our research was to compare molsidomine, SIN-1, SIN-1A, and lidocaine influence on arrhythmias and hemodynamic parameters in 2 experimental models in rats. In the Langendorff heart study, SIN-1A markedly elevated left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum rise and fall of the first pressure derivative, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption. In addition, SIN-1A more so than SIN-1 significantly lowered creatine kinase release. The antiarrhythmic action of SIN-1 was observed, while lidocaine significantly diminished ventricular arrhythmias duration in comparison with the control. In the ischemia-reperfusion-induced arrhythmias model, hypotensive action of molsidomine was observed as well as the reduction in pressure rate product. Molsidomine also prolonged ventricular tachycardia duration. On the other hand, no significant effects on hemodynamic parameters as well as on ventricular arrhythmias were found in any of the SIN-1 and SIN-1A groups. In conclusion, our research suggests a possible direct, cardioprotective action of SIN-1A. It seems worthwhile to further investigate molsidomine derivatives, especially SIN-1A, because of its potential use in invasive cardiology procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. </AbstractText>

Using a concept mapping methodology, participants discussed client/patient inclusion in IPC assessments, and through a consensus process, chose a demonstration project for further development. </AbstractText>

Using data from Monitoring the Future (2011), we employed a series of logistic regression models to establish predictors of 12-month self-reported Adderall or Ritalin use without a doctor's note among eighth and tenth graders. Whereas studies of college students have found NPSU to correlate with instrumental motives and productivity-related demands, we find no association between NPSU and indicators of academic strain for this younger sample. Rather, we find that the age of onset and current use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are most predictive of NPSU, which are substances generally associated with social and recreational consumption settings. These findings have potential implications for practitioners concerned with mitigating the harms of general prescription drug misuse, as intervention efforts informed by research conducted among college students may not readily apply to younger populations. Drawing from central tenets of developmental and life course criminology, we call for continued inquiry into the broader socialization and developmental processes that influence NPSU and other prescription drug use patterns prior to early adulthood. </AbstractText>

Results showed that although participants have different level of death thought accessibility between an organ donation scenario and a general charity scenario, their willingness for prosocial behaviors were not significantly different between the two scenarios, indicating that under the influence of Chinese culture MS did not decrease prosocial behaviors. Our findings point to the importance of uncovering the role of Chinese philosophy about death and life in shaping people's positive death reflection. </AbstractText>

Only 39% believed in the utility of the rigid long backboard to protect the pediatric spine. For most risk factors in both age categories, a rigid cervical collar with a long backboard with a soft conforming surface was the most common response (28-40% depending on age group and risk factor); however, there were no consensus beliefs. Provider-level experience, working as a patient care provider, less education, and parent status were associated with endorsing the rigid cervical collar.

Previous research suggests that physicians' focus on strict glycemic control and negative outcomes can result in fear and uncertainty about undertaking pregnancy. The present study was designed to gain insight into the lived pregnancy experiences of women with type-1 diabetes and to solicit their thoughts on what health care providers could do to assist them to have a healthy pregnancy. Ten U.S. women with type-1 diabetes who were currently pregnant and/or had previously given birth participated in structured interviews. They described the hard work required to attain the strict glycemic control necessary during pregnancy to maintain their health and that of their fetus. However, they found diabetes and pregnancy to be a more positive and successful experience than they had anticipated. The results suggest that early diabetes education, pregnancy planning, and social support are important, yet often overlooked, factors that increase the likelihood of physically and emotionally successful pregnancy experiences for women with type-1 diabetes. </AbstractText>

We set up case-based teaching scenarios involving a real patient, aimed at small groups of four students representing two or more healthcare professions. The aim of the sessions was to give students a greater awareness of the roles of all the different healthcare professions involved in patient care in a hospital setting. Weekly sessions were offered on six wards covering different clinical specialties. Three hundred and twenty-nine undergraduate students from different healthcare professions (nursing, medicine, pharmacy, midwifery, physician associate, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech, and language therapy) each attended one IPL session during the current academic year. Students were given an evaluation sheet at the end of each session to be filled out anonymously. Forty per cent of the students reported experiencing interprofessional case-based learning for the first time. Over 90% of students agreed or strongly agreed with a list of statements promoting the advantages and benefits of case-based IPL for undergraduate students and many of them requested more sessions. Seventy per cent of all respondents stated they would alter their future professional behaviour as a result of this session. We propose to introduce the sessions into the undergraduate curriculum across all healthcare related professions. </AbstractText>

We sought to determine if Paramedics can initiate the CMS sepsis core measure bundle in the prehospital field reliably. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This is a retrospective, case series from a 3rd service EMS system model in Greenville, South Carolina between November 17, 2014 and February 20, 2016. An adult Prehospital Sepsis Assessment Tool was created using the 2012 Surviving Sepsis guidelines: 2 of 3 signs of systemic inflammatory response (heart rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature) and a known or suspected source of infection. A "Sepsis Alert" was called by paramedics and upon IV access a set of blood cultures and blood for lactate analysis was collected prior to field antibiotic administration. The Sepsis Alert was compared to serum lactate levels and ICD 9 or 10 admitting diagnosis of Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, or Septic Shock. Blood culture contamination, serum lactate, and antibiotic match were determined by in-hospital laboratory analysis. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 120 trained paramedics called 1,185 "Sepsis Alerts" on 56,643 patients (50.3% Male, mean age 70).

We did so by first conducting a critical reading of the Polish Constitution, public opinion polls, national censuses, etc. Then, we presented the results of a discourse analysis on families of choice in Poland from crucial public debates of the last decade. Through this we identified the main public strategies of silencing and excluding, its dynamics, main actors, possible changes, and shifts over time. The results of the research showed the change that occurred in the public discourse on LGBT families in the last decades in Poland moving from defining family in very conservative and traditional terms at the beginning of the 2000s to a more open definition of family in 2010-2011. However, they also demonstrate some undesired alliances among supporters and opponents of same sex partnership, and possible dangers of some strategies used by LGBT activists. </AbstractText>

In fact, the entirety of pedagogical structures in many schools creates milieus where queer youth, those who have loved ones who are queer, and those who are merely perceived to be queer are systematically marginalized and deprived of their right to a safe, supportive, and equitable educational experience. Transformative leadership theory (TLT) inspires educational leaders to create inclusive and excellent schools for all youth. Neither a prescriptive model nor a process-oriented theory, TLT offers eight tenets that operate in concert to form an authentic way of being informing and guiding leaders' decisions and actions towards the goal of individual, organizational, and societal change. </AbstractText>

They die sooner than they should, and smoking is a major contributor to their high rates of morbid chronic physical health conditions and early mortality, compared to the general population. Family carers provide important support to people with mental illness. However, family carers' perspectives of smoking by their family members with mental illness are largely absent from the research literature and from practice, despite smoking rates remaining high and quit rates remaining low for this population. We know little about how family carers are, or could be involved in supporting people with mental illness who smoke to stop smoking. This paper aims to provide a discussion of the opportunities for family carers to support their family member's smoking cessation and a discussion of our preliminary research on this topic. From the available literature, it appears that family carers are well placed to support smoking cessation for this population; however, they struggled physically, philosophically and emotionally with perceived responsibilities involving their family member's smoking and the caring role. They felt isolated and asserted that there was limited support from service providers to assist them. We concluded that family carers are important agents within the person's immediate environment who could help them to improve their smoking cessation success. This suggests also that mental health services and other health service providers could benefit from including family carers in their efforts to support smoking cessation for people with mental illness who smoke. </AbstractText>

Although an opioid, at therapeutic doses it acts primarily on the gastrointestinal tissues; however, larger than recommended amounts facilitate central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Such high doses of loperamide have recently gained popularity among users of opioids to manage withdrawal symptomatology and, less frequently, to achieve psychoactive effects. Chronic loperamide use can result in development of tolerance and, upon abrupt cessation of use, withdrawal. With increasing prevalence of use, side-effects are noted, one particularly being life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Users are often not forthcoming and routine drug screens do not detect loperamide, so providers need to be alert to such practices in order to recognize intoxication, be able to screen for use, and facilitate entry into treatment. </AbstractText>

Preclinical studies suggest that harmine may have neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects, and retrospective/observational investigations of the mental health of long-term ayahuasca users suggest that prolonged use of this harmine-rich hallucinogen is associated with better neuropsychological functioning. Thus, in order to better investigate these possibilities, we performed a systematic literature review of preclinical studies analyzing the effects of harmine on hippocampal neurons and in memory-related behavioral tasks in animal models. We found two studies involving hippocampal cell cultures and nine studies using animal models. Harmine administration was associated with neuroprotective effects such as reduced excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Harmine also improved memory/learning in several animal models. These effects seem be mediated by monoamine oxidase or acetylcholinesterase inhibition, upregulation of glutamate transporters, decreases in reactive oxygen species, increases in neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory effects. The neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects of harmine should be further investigated in both preclinical and human studies. </AbstractText>

Preliminary research has also linked peritraumatic emotional responses with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). The majority of this research has been cross-sectional, thereby making it difficult to determine the extent to which the various peritraumatic emotional responses may increase risk for, or serve as a premorbid marker of, PTSD and MDD. This study examined the longitudinal role of peritraumatic emotional responses on the subsequent development of PTSD and MDD in a sample of United States military veterans. Whereas a number of peritraumatic emotional responses were concurrently associated with PTSD, only peritraumatic numbness maintained the association with these diagnoses longitudinally. For MDD, peritraumatic numbness was the only emotional response related to the diagnosis both concurrently and longitudinally. Study findings are a preliminary proof of concept that peritraumatic numbness may serve as a premorbid marker for the development of PTSD and MDD following a traumatic event. Implications of these findings for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of both PTSD and MDD are discussed. </AbstractText>

The mediating effects of external resources were also investigated. Questionnaires were completed between 2001 and 2012 by 561 Israeli mothers. Shortly after birth, mothers at risk for poorer MMH were those who gave birth prematurely or were characterized by insecure attachment styles, lower marital quality, younger age, or a higher level of education. The mothers with a good prognosis for improvement in MMH were those who had given birth prematurely or were younger, more highly educated, or multiparous. Women with insecure attachment or lower marital quality reported lower MMH one month after delivery that did not improve over time, and the MMH of older or less educated mothers deteriorated over time. Marital quality mitigated or exacerbated the effects of birth circumstances and insecure attachment style on MMH shortly after giving birth.

This prospective study examines the prevalence of auditory hallucinations in trauma survivors and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, over time. Former prisoners-of-war (ex-POWs) from the 1973 Yom Kippur War (n = 99) with and without PTSD and comparable veterans (n = 103) were assessed twice, in 1991 (T1) and 2003 (T2) in regards to auditory hallucinations and PTSD symptoms. Findings indicated that ex-POWs who suffered from PTSD reported higher levels of auditory hallucinations at T2 as well as increased hallucinations over time, compared to ex-POWs without PTSD and combatants who did not endure captivity. The relation between PTSD and auditory hallucinations was unidirectional, so that the PTSD overall score at T1 predicted an increase in auditory hallucinations between T1 and T2, but not vice versa. Assessing the role of PTSD clusters in predicting hallucinations revealed that intrusion symptoms had a unique contribution, compared to avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms. The findings suggest that auditory hallucinations might be a consequence of the posttraumatic reaction among veterans. </AbstractText>

Over the course of 18 months, volunteers screening for research studies in the Opioid Laboratory at the New York State Psychiatric Institute completed a locally developed self-assessment questionnaire. A total of 138 adults with OUD (24 female, 114 male) with a mean age of 46.5 years (SD = 9.5 yrs) were assessed. Significant differences among the four racial/ethnic subgroups (n = 65 African-Americans, n = 34 Hispanics, n = 31 Caucasians or Whites, n = 8 Multiracial) were found. Whites were the youngest (p = 0.001), most frequently injecting drugs (p < 0.001), and engaged more often in risky drug use and sexual behaviors, although their virus transmission knowledge was comparable to that of the other subgroups. Few participants had heard about PrEP. White opioid users showed the most risk behaviors among races/ethnicities, despite comparable prevention knowledge.

In this study,Corynebacterium glutamicum was metabolically engineered to efficiently produce 3-HP from glucose and xylose via the glycerol pathway. A functional 3-HP synthesis pathway was engineered through a combination of genes involved in glycerol synthesis (fusion of gpd and gpp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 3-HP production (pduCDEGH from Klebsiella pneumoniae and aldehyde dehydrogenases from various resources). High 3-HP yield was achieved by screening of active aldehyde dehydrogenases and by minimizing byproduct synthesis (gapA(A1G)?ldhA?pta-ackA?poxB?glpK). Substitution of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose uptake system (PTS) by inositol permeases (iolT1) and glucokinase (glk) further increased 3-HP production to 38.6g/L, with the yield of 0.48g/g glucose. To broaden its substrate spectrum, the engineered strain was modified to incorporate the pentose transport gene araE and xylose catabolic gene xylAB, allowing for the simultaneous utilization of glucose and xylose. Combination of these genetic manipulations resulted in an engineered C. glutamicum strain capable of producing 62.6g/L 3-HP at a yield of 0.51g/g glucose in fed-batch fermentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest titer and yield of 3-HP from sugar. This is also the first report for the production of 3-HP from xylose, opening the way toward 3-HP production from abundant lignocellulosic feedstocks. </AbstractText>

Monocyte/macrophages are the key cells of this adverse reaction. Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is the most important chemokine regulating trafficking of monocyte/macrophages in particle-induced inflammation. 7ND recombinant protein is a mutant of CCL2 that inhibits CCL2 signaling. We have recently developed a layer-by-layer (LBL) coating platform on implant surfaces that can release biologically active 7ND. In this study, we investigated the effect of 7ND on wear particle-induced bone loss using the murine continuous polyethylene (PE) particle infusion model with 7ND coating of a titanium rod as a local drug delivery device. PE particles were infused into hollow titanium rods with or without 7ND coating implanted in the distal femur for 4 weeks. Specific groups were also injected with RAW 264.7 as the reporter macrophages. Wear particle-induced bone loss and the effects of 7ND were evaluated by microCT, immunohistochemical staining, and bioluminescence imaging. Local delivery of 7ND using the LBL coating decreased systemic macrophage recruitment, the number of osteoclasts and wear particle-induced bone loss. The development of a novel orthopaedic implant coating with anti-CCL2 protein may be a promising strategy to mitigate peri-prosthetic osteolysis. </AbstractText>

In this review, I discuss computational models and principles that provide insight into how this process of multisensory integration occurs at the behavioral and neural level. My initial focus is on drift-diffusion and Bayesian models that can predict behavior in multisensory contexts. I then highlight how recent neurophysiological and perturbation experiments provide evidence for a distributed redundant network for multisensory integration. I also emphasize studies which show that task-relevant variables in multisensory contexts are distributed in heterogeneous neural populations. Finally, I describe dimensionality reduction methods and recurrent neural network models that may help decipher heterogeneous neural populations involved in multisensory integration. </AbstractText>

However, not all individuals experience significant emotional distress following failure, indicating the presence of resilience. The current systematic review synthesised studies investigating resilience factors to emotional distress resulting from the experience of failure. For the definition of resilience we used the Bi-Dimensional Framework for resilience research (BDF) which suggests that resilience factors are those which buffer the impact of risk factors, and outlines criteria a variable should meet in order to be considered as conferring resilience. Studies were identified through electronic searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge. Forty-six relevant studies reported in 38 papers met the inclusion criteria. These provided evidence of the presence of factors which confer resilience to emotional distress in response to failure. The strongest support was found for the factors of higher self-esteem, more positive attributional style, and lower socially-prescribed perfectionism. Weaker evidence was found for the factors of lower trait reappraisal, lower self-oriented perfectionism and higher emotional intelligence. The majority of studies used experimental or longitudinal designs. These results identify specific factors which should be targeted by resilience-building interventions.

Among the 3991 included patients, 1861 hospitalizations occurred (hospitalization rate of 10.44/100 person-years, 95% confidence interval 9.98-10.93/100 person-years). Hospitalization rates decreased annually (per year incidence rate ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.95) as well as length of stay (median of 15 days in 2007 vs. 11 days in 2013, p-value for trend<0.001), and in-hospital mortality (13.4% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2013, p-value for trend=0.053). Our results show that, in a middle-income setting, hospitalization rates are decreasing over time and non-AIDS hospitalizations are currently more frequent than those related to AIDS. Notwithstanding, compared with high-income settings, our patients had longer length of stay and higher in-hospital mortality. Further studies addressing these outcomes are needed to provide information that may guide protocols and interventions to further reduce health-care costs and in-hospital mortality. </AbstractText>

This work presents cytotoxicity assays performed with ferrocenyl diamine hydrochlorides in six different strains of T. cruzi epimastigote forms (Y, Bolivia, SI1, SI8, QMII, and SIGR3). The last four strains have been recently isolated from triatominae and mammalian host (domestic cat). The expression of mTcTXNPx was analyzed by the Western blotting technique using polyclonal antibody anti mTcTXNPx obtained from a rabbit immunized with the mTcTXNPx recombinant protein. All the tested ferrocenyl diamine hydrochlorides were more cytotoxic than benznidazole. The expression of the 25.5kDa polypeptide of mTcTXNPx did not increase in strains that were more resistant to the ferrocenyl compounds (SI8 and SIGR3). In addition, a 58kDa polypeptide was also recognized in all strains. Ferrocenyl diamine hydrochlorides showed trypanocidal activity and the expression of 25.5kDa mTcTXNPx is not necessarily increased in some T. cruzi strains. Most likely, other mechanisms, in addition to the over expression of this antioxidative enzyme, should be involved in the escape of parasites from cytotoxic oxidant agents. </AbstractText>

Compared with the care burden gender gap, the within-gender gap in women's socioeconomic status (SES) has attracted less policy attention. We investigated the association between middle-aged women's SES and the likelihood of being a primary caregiver for elderly informal care, focusing on household income, women's marital status, work status, and educational background under the universal and public system of formal long-term care provision in Japan. We used repeated cross-sectional data from nationally representative household surveys conducted between 2010 and 2013 to obtain a sample of 2399 women aged between 40 and 60 years living in the same household as a care recipient. We conducted multiple logistic regression analysis to obtain odds ratios of being a primary caregiver in the household regressed on women's SES variables, adjusting for the characteristics of care recipients and household composition. The results showed that single women with lower education were likely to be primary caregivers when the care recipients had severe levels of care needs, whereas the association was null in the case of care recipients with milder conditions. The results indicated that women's low education and non-married status were related to a higher likelihood of becoming a primary caregiver of severely disabled elderly for reasons other than lower economic power. To emancipate socioeconomically vulnerable women from the care burden, a broader set of social, economic, and welfare policies are needed. </AbstractText>

Forces representing global back muscles and global abdominal muscles, follower loads and an upper body weight were applied. The force of the global back muscles was reduced to 75%, 50% and 25% to simulate different degrees of back muscle weakness. An additional boundary condition which represented the loads from other muscles after exercise therapy was set up to keep the spine in a neutral standing position.

Here, we investigated the relationship between summary (ensemble) statistics and visual attention. Recently, it was claimed that one ensemble statistic in particular, color diversity, can be perceived without focal attention. However, a broader debate exists over the attentional requirements of conscious perception, and it is possible that some form of attention is necessary for ensemble perception. To test this idea, we employed a modified inattentional blindness paradigm and found that multiple types of summary statistics (color and size) often go unnoticed without attention. In addition, we found attentional costs in dual-task situations, further implicating a role for attention in statistical perception. Overall, we conclude that while visual ensembles may be processed efficiently, some amount of attention is necessary for conscious perception of ensemble statistics. </AbstractText>

Dissociative individuals may find it harder to regulate sleepiness in the face of sleep disruption. Although there is significant variability in reactions to sleep deprivation, research on trait predictors is scarce. The present study examined the ability of trait dissociation to prospectively predict sleepiness following sleep loss and recovery sleep. Two high-functioning samples, namely, Remotely Piloted Aircraft officers (N=29) and Air Force jet pilots (N=57) completed state and trait questionnaires assessing sleep and dissociation before and after full or partial sleep loss. Dissociative absorption was a consistent predictor of an increase in sleepiness following sleep loss and following recovery sleep, controlling for baseline sleepiness levels. We discuss the findings in light of a difficulty to regulate and monitor consciousness states. </AbstractText>

Materials with a high proportion of lipids, such as white matter tissue, show a reduced intensity in magnetic resonance images acquired with selective prepulses at positive and negative offsets simultaneously compared to images with a single positive or negative offset prepulse of the same power. This effect was initially explained on the basis of hole-burning in inhomogeneously broadened lines of the lipid proton spin system. Our results contradict this explanation. ihMT in lipids can be understood with a simple spin-1 model of a coupled methylene proton pair. More generally, Provotorov theory can be used to consider the evolution of dipolar order in the non-aqueous spins during the prepulses. We show that the flip-angle dependence of the proton spectrum of a model lipid system (Prolipid-161) following dipolar order generation is in quantitative agreement with the model. In addition, we directly observe dipolar order and ihMT signals in the non-aqueous components of Prolipid-161 and homogeneously-broadened systems (hair, wood, and tendon) following ihMT prepulses. The observation of ihMT signals in tendon suggests that the technique may not be as specific to myelin as previously thought. Our work shows that ihMT occurs because of dipolar couplings alone, not from a specific type of spectral line broadening as its name suggests. </AbstractText>

However, the temporal changes in gene expression of condylar cartilage during continuous ID remain unclear. The aim of the current study is to investigate by microarray analysis, the differentially-expressed gene pattern in condylar cartilage of rabbits with ID from one to eight weeks of ID progression. Histological results (hematoxylin and eosin staining) indicated that abnormal collagen fiber arrangements, fragmentation of fibrils, and inflammatory cell-infiltration were detected from one to four weeks in joint disc specimens, while newly formed vessels, mucoid degeneration, meniscal tears, and the presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts were observed at later time points. The microarray analysis revealed 6478 genes among all tested transcripts, to have a greater than two-fold expression change compared to controls. The inflammation-associated gene group including ace and il1? increased rapidly in the early stage of disease and decreased later. In contrast, bone construction-related genes showed low expression levels at first and increased at later period in the ID progression. The current study also found some genes such as hla2g, which have not been previously reported, to be potentially relevant within ID.

However, at the population level, such patterns of cancer care are poorly described, complicating clinical research. To determine the population-based prevalence and characteristics of patients seen by multiple institutions, we used operations data from a state-mandated cancer registry. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS AND MATERIALS" NlmCategory="METHODS">59,672 invasive cancers diagnosed in 1/1/2010-12/31/2011 in the Greater Bay Area of northern California were categorized as having been reported to the cancer registry within 365days of diagnosis by: 1) ?1 institution within an integrated health system (IHS); 2) IHS institution(s) and ?1 non-IHS institution (e.g., private hospital); 3) 1 non-IHS institution; or 4) ?2 non-IHS institutions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to characterize patients reported by multiple vs. single institutions. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Overall in this region, 17% of cancers were reported by multiple institutions. Of the 33% reported by an IHS, 8% were also reported by a non-IHS. Of non-IHS patients, 21% were reported by multiple institutions, with 28% for breast and 27% for pancreatic cancer, but 19%% for lung and 18% for prostate cancer. Generally, patients more likely to be seen by multiple institutions were younger or had more severe disease at diagnosis. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Population-based data show that one in six newly diagnosed cancer patients received care from multiple institutions, and differed from patients seen only at a single institution. Cancer care data from single institutions may be incomplete and possibly biased. </AbstractText>

27918908|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">The mirror effect - a phenomenon whereby a manipulation produces opposite effects on hit and false alarm rates - is benchmark regularity of recognition memory. A likelihood ratio decision process, basing recognition on the relative likelihood that a stimulus is a target or a lure, naturally predicts the mirror effect, and so has been widely adopted in quantitative models of recognition memory. Glanzer, Hilford, and Maloney (2009) demonstrated that likelihood ratio models, assuming Gaussian memory strength, are also capable of explaining regularities observed in receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs), such as greater target than lure variance. Despite its central place in theorising about recognition memory, however, this class of models has not been tested using response time (RT) distributions. In this article, we develop a linear approximation to the likelihood ratio transformation, which we show predicts the same regularities as the exact transformation. This development enabled us to develop a tractable model of recognition-memory RT based on the diffusion decision model (DDM), with inputs (drift rates) provided by an approximate likelihood ratio transformation. We compared this "LR-DDM" to a standard DDM where all targets and lures receive their own drift rate parameters. Both were implemented as hierarchical Bayesian models and applied to four datasets. Model selection taking into account parsimony favored the LR-DDM, which requires fewer parameters than the standard DDM but still fits the data well. These results support log-likelihood based models as providing an elegant explanation of the regularities of recognition memory, not only in terms of choices made but also in terms of the times it takes to make them. </AbstractText>

Using self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), the goal of this study was to test a serial multiple mediator model. In this model, students' perceptions of autonomy support from their extracurricular activity leader predicted their activity-based intrinsic and identified regulations. In turn, these regulations predicted their school-based intrinsic and identified regulations during the same school year. Finally, these regulations predicted their school-based intrinsic and identified regulations one year later. A total of 276 youths (54% girls) from disadvantaged neighborhoods were surveyed over two waves of data collection. The proposed mediation model was supported for both types of regulation. These results highlight the generalization effects of motivation from the extracurricular activity context to the school context. </AbstractText>

Previous studies investigating brain networks in MDD during the performance of a task have yielded inconsistent results with the function of the brain at rest. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during a goal-directed task to investigate dynamics of functional connectivity in 19 unmedicated patients with MDD and 19 healthy controls across both experimental paradigms. Patients had spatial differences in the default mode network (DMN), in the executive network (EN), and in the dorsal attention network (DAN) compared to controls at rest and during task performance. In patients the amplitude of the low frequency (LFO) oscillations was reduced in the motor and in the DAN networks during both paradigms. There was a diagnosis by paradigm interaction on the LFOs amplitude of the salience network, with increased amplitude change between task and rest in patients relative to controls. Our findings suggest that the function of several networks could be intrinsically affected in MDD and this could be viable phenotype for the investigation on the neurobiological mechanisms of this disorder and its treatment. </AbstractText>

Morphological changes in the neuroanatomy of this syndrome may represent a biological risk factor for the development of psychosis. The present study explored ratios between cortical volumes and the amygdala. We also explored relationships between these ratios and the eventual development of psychosis in youth with 22q11DS. A group of 73 individuals with 22q11DS, 32 community controls, and 27 unaffected siblings were followed every three years, at four timepoints. We analyzed baseline ratios between 34 bilateral FreeSurfer-generated cortical volumes and amygdala, and examined whether baseline cortical ratios predicted positive symptoms of psychosis 12 years later, at the 4th timepoint. Youth with 22q11DS demonstrated significantly smaller cortical volume-to-amygdala ratios in left anterior cingulate, occipital and parietal cortices. An increased risk of developing psychotic episodes in individuals with 22q11DS was associated with a lower cortical volume- to-amygdala ratio, suggesting that cortico-limbic circuitry may play an important role in emotional modulation and may underlie the pathophysiology of positive symptoms of psychosis. </AbstractText>

CYP2D6 is among the CYP enzymes with the highest expression levels in the brain, suggesting a role in the local brain metabolism of psychotropic drugs and the existence of endogenous substrates. The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6, which causes individual differences in activity levels of the enzyme, has also been characterized functionally in human brain imaging studies. Here we explore the feasibility of predicting CYP2D6 phenotype using component-wise gradient boosting on fMRI resting brain perfusion images. The images belonged to subjects showing a range of genetic CYP2D6 variants. We achieved sensitivity and specificity values between 85% and 87% for the classification of ultrarapid metabolisers, and between 71% and 79% for poor metabolisers. An extension of the boosting algorithm, developed to improve the clinical plausibility of the inherently sparse models, produced enhanced models in agreement with the results of previous studies, showing some brain regions as positively associated with genotypic variation, most prominently in the prefrontal white matter and the corpus callosum. With further development, such a probabilistic method might constitute a valuable, non-invasive alternative to actual genotyping. </AbstractText>

Here we show that it is possible to take skeletal muscle satellite cells from jaw muscles of the adult mouse and to direct their differentiation to become heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). This is done by exposing the cells to extracellular factors similar to those which heart progenitors would experience during normal embryonic development. By contrast, cardiac differentiation does not occur at all from satellite cells isolated from trunk and limb muscles, which originate from the somites of the embryo. The cardiomyocytes arising from jaw muscle satellite cells express a range of specific marker proteins, beat spontaneously, display long action potentials with appropriate responses to nifedipine, norepinephrine and carbachol, and show synchronized calcium transients. Our results show the existence of a persistent cardiac developmental competence in satellite cells of the adult jaw muscles, associated with their origin from the second heart field of the embryo, and suggest a possible method of obtaining cardiomyocytes from individual patients without the need for a heart biopsy. </AbstractText>

We previously found that androgens induce CTNNB1 signaling in mouse urogenital sinus (UGS) epithelium from which prostatic ductal epithelium derives. Others have shown that low estradiol concentrations induce UGS epithelial proliferative growth. Here, we found that CTNNB1 signaling overlaps cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in prostatic buds and we used a genetic approach to test whether CTNNB1 signaling induces CCND1 expression. We observed an unexpected sexually dimorphic response to hyperactive CCNTB1 signaling: in male mouse UGS it increased Ccnd1 mRNA abundance without increasing its protein abundance but in female UGS it increased Ccnd1 mRNA and protein abundance, suggesting a potential role for estrogens in stabilizing CCND1 protein. Treating wild type male UGS explants with androgen and either 17?-estradiol or a proteasome inhibitor increased CCND1 protein and KI67 labeling in prostatic bud epithelium. Together, our results are consistent with an epithelial proliferative growth mechanism linking CTNNB1-driven Ccnd1 transcription and estrogen-mediated CCND1 protein stabilization. </AbstractText>

However, identification of protein amidation sites through traditional experimental methods is time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a novel predictor for Prediction of Amidation Sites (PrAS), which is the first software package for academic users. The method incorporated four representative feature types, which are position-based features, physicochemical and biochemical properties features, predicted structure-based features and evolutionary information features. A novel feature selection method, positive contribution feature selection was proposed to optimize features. PrAS achieved AUC of 0.96, accuracy of 92.1%, sensitivity of 81.2%, specificity of 94.9% and MCC of 0.76 on the independent test set.

The obtained breakthrough curves showed that the breakthrough time increased with increasing bed height, but decreased with increasing flow rate and increasing particle size. The Thomas model and bed depth service time model could accurately predict the bed dynamic behavior. At a bed height of 10 cm, a flow rate of 10 mL/min, and with ES particle sizes of 0.18-0.425 mm, for a multi-component heavy metal solution containing Cd(2+), Pb(2+) and Cu(2+), the ES capacities were found to be 1.57, 146.44 and 387.51 mg/g, respectively. The acidity of AMD effluent clearly decreased. The ES fixed-bed showed the highest removal efficiency for Pb with a better adsorption potential. Because of the high concentration in AMD and high removal efficiency in ES fixed-bed of iron ions, iron floccules (Fe2(OH)2CO3) formed and obstructed the bed to develop the overall effectiveness. The removal process was dominated by precipitation under the alkaline reaction of ES, and the co-precipitation of heavy metals with iron ions. The findings of this work will aid in guiding and optimizing pilot-scale application of ES to AMD treatment. </AbstractText>

The mobile phone wastes (contactors) were collected and characterized. The valuable metals were extracted by thiourea leaching. The adsorption of valuable metals from leachates was studied according to the kinetic and equilibrium viewpoints. It was found that the contactors were composed by Au, Ni, Cu and Sn. The thiourea leaching provided extraction percentages of 68.6% for Au, 22.1% for Ni and 2.8% for Cu. Sn was not extracted. The leachate presented 17.5 mg L(-1) of Au, 324.9 mg L(-1) of Ni and 573.1 mg L(-1) of Cu. The adsorption was fast, being the equilibrium attained within 120 min. The adsorption of Au, Ni and Cu onto CTN and AC followed the Langmuir model, while, the adsorption of these metals onto CTS, followed the Freundlich model. Removal percentages higher than 95% were obtained for all metals, depending of the type and amount of adsorbent. It was demonstrated that the adsorption onto chitin, chitosan and activated carbon can be an alternative to recover valuable metals from leachates of mobile phone wastes. </AbstractText>

PVA derived from petroleum is the primary sizing agent due to its excellent sizing performance on polyester-containing yarns, especially in increasingly prevailing high-speed weaving. However, due to the poor biodegradability, PVA causes serious environmental pollution, and thus, should be substituted with more environmentally friendly polymers. Soy protein treated with high amount of triethanolamine was found with acceptable sizing properties. However, triethanolamine is also non-biodegradable and originated from petroleum, therefore, is not an ideal additive. In this research, soy sizes were developed from soy protein treated with glycerol, the biodegradable triol that could also be obtained from soy. The soy sizes had good film properties, adhesion to polyester and abrasion resistance close to PVA, rendering them qualified for sizing applications. Regarding desizing, consumption of water and energy for removal of soy size could be remarkably decreased, comparing to removal of PVA. Moreover, with satisfactory degradability, the wastewater containing soy sizes was readily dischargeable after treated in activated sludge for two days. In summary, the fully biodegradable soy sizes had potential to substitute PVA for sustainable textile processing. </AbstractText>

Concerns over the extent to which the reserve network was living up to this ideal led to the development of a new strategy in 1995 (the Seville Strategy) to enhance the operation of the network of reserves. An evaluation of effectiveness of management of the biosphere reserve network was called for as part of this strategy. Expert opinion was assembled through a Delphi Process to identify successful and less successful reserves and investigate common factors influencing success or failure. Ninety biosphere reserves including sixty successful and thirty less successful reserves in 42 countries across all five Man and the Biosphere Program regions were identified. Most successful sites are the post-Seville generation while the majority of unsuccessful sites are pre-Seville that are managed as national parks and have not been amended to conform to the characteristics that are meant to define a biosphere reserve. Stakeholder participation and collaboration, governance, finance and resources, management, and awareness and communication are the most influential factors in the success or failure of the biosphere reserves. For success, the biosphere reserve concept needs to be clearly understood and applied through landscape zoning. Designated reserves then need a management system with inclusive good governance, strong participation and collaboration, adequate finance and human resource allocation and stable and responsible management and implementation. All rather obvious but it is difficult to achieve without commitment to the biosphere reserve concept by the governance authorities. </AbstractText>

There are differences in subcortical brain structures between patients with MDD and healthy controls, but the specific impact of childhood adversity on such structures in MDD remains unclear. Thus, aim of the present study was to investigate whether childhood adversity is associated with subcortical volumes and how it interacts with a diagnosis of MDD and sex. Within the ENIGMA-MDD network, nine university partner sites, which assessed childhood adversity and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with MDD and controls, took part in the current joint mega-analysis. In this largest effort world-wide to identify subcortical brain structure differences related to childhood adversity, 3036 participants were analyzed for subcortical brain volumes using FreeSurfer. A significant interaction was evident between childhood adversity, MDD diagnosis, sex, and region. Increased exposure to childhood adversity was associated with smaller caudate volumes in females independent of MDD. All subcategories of childhood adversity were negatively associated with caudate volumes in females - in particular emotional neglect and physical neglect (independently from age, ICV, imaging site and MDD diagnosis). There was no interaction effect between childhood adversity and MDD diagnosis on subcortical brain volumes. Childhood adversity is one of the contributors to brain structural abnormalities. It is associated with subcortical brain abnormalities that are relevant to psychiatric disorders such as depression. </AbstractText>

The analysis results showed that the spatial distributions of main chemical components in groundwater had great variations with statistical concentrations in the order of TDS> HCO3> Ca> NO3> Cl> Na> SO4> Mg> K> NH4> NO2. As for NO3, it ranged from less than 0.02mg/L to 497mg/L with an average value of 39.46mg/L indicating an obviously anthropogenic pollution. Even more than 32% of the samples exceeded the Grade III threshold (20mg/L of N) according to China's standard. The results obtained from principal component analysis showed that high NO3 concentration could be attributed to human activities, especially the excessive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture. Further, a human health risk assessment (HHRA) model derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was applied to estimate the potential health risk of groundwater nitrate considering both drinking water and dermal contact pathways. The results indicated that potential health risks of adult males and females within about 60% of the area were at the acceptable level, while those within about 40% were beyond the acceptable level. The area at the acceptable level for children covered 49% of the total area while the same value for infants was 37%. The NO3 concentration in southeast and northeast of the study area was the highest so that residents in these regions were at the highest health risk. In conclusion, risk levels for different crowds in the study area varied obviously, generally in the order of infants> children> adult females> adult males, and the potential health risks of residents, especially minors and rural residents, should cause enough attention both from the society and the academic community. </AbstractText>

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of two antibiotics commonly used in livestock industry, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur, on metal removal by CWs. Microcosms (0.4m×0.3m×0.3m), simulating CWs, were constructed with Phragmites australis to treat livestock wastewater spiked or not with 100µg/L of enrofloxacin or ceftiofur (individually or in mixture). Wastewater was treated during 20 one-week cycles. After one-week cycle wastewater was removed and replaced by new wastewater (with or without spiking). At weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 18 and 20, treated wastewater was analysed to determine the removal rates of metals (Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) and of each antibiotic. At weeks 1, 8 and 20 portions of the plant root substrate were collected and metals determined. At the end of the experiment metal levels were also determined in plant tissues. Removal rate of Fe from wastewater was 99%. Removal rates of Cu and Zn were higher than 85% and 89%, respectively, whereas for Mn removal rates up to 75% were obtained. In general, no significant differences were observed through time in the removals of the different metals, indicating that the systems maintained their functionality during the experimental period. Antibiotics did not interfere with the system depuration capacity, in terms of metals removals from wastewater, and ceftiofur even promoted metal uptake by P. australis. Therefore, CWs seem to be a valuable alternative to remove pollutants, including antibiotics and metals, from livestock wastewaters, reducing the risk the release of these wastewaters might pose into the environment, although more research should be conducted with other antibiotics in CWs. </AbstractText>

The current research aimed to understand the association between alcohol consumption and WP smoke exposure among WP lounge patrons. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Seventy-one lounge patrons (66.2% male; Mage=27.03, SD=5.32) completed pre- and post-WP session self-report measures and biomarkers of smoking (expired carbon monoxide; eCO) and alcohol consumption (breath alcohol concentration; BrAC) upon entering and exiting the WP lounge. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">After controlling for number of bowls and charcoals smoked, greater consumption of alcohol was associated with greater smoke exposure among WP lounge patrons (p<0.05), such that a 0.1 unit increase in BrAC was associated with an eCO increase of 19.44ppm. This relationship was mediated by time spent in the WP lounge. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Concurrent alcohol use resulted in greater eCO, likley due to participants spending a greater amount of time in the WP lounge and experiencing longer sustained exposure to secondhand smoke. These findings illustrate a need for further research on the impact of alcohol consumption on WP smoking to assess the potential need for regulation of these products in WP lounges. </AbstractText>

Ample animal-science evidence and nascent ecological evidence points toward developmentally limited differences in sensitivity to alcohol's stimulatory and sedative effects. Field-based research methods were used to test for such age-related differences in a sample of adolescents through young adults. Potential moderating influences of estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC), as well as typical consumption and level of dependence/consequences were explored. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Subjective alcohol responses were collected from 1,364 participants, aged 17 to 32 years, recruited outside of venues where drinking takes place in a small metropolitan bar district. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Self-reports of stimulatory response to alcohol were age-related, such that younger participants reported increased subjective stimulation at the time of data collection relative to older participants. Age-related differences in stimulatory responses were more pronounced at lower eBACs and among younger participants who typically drank more heavily. Stimulatory responses generally diminished among older than younger participants, although individuals with greater dependence/consequences consistently reported greater stimulation from drinking. Contrastingly, age, typical consumption, and dependence/consequences were not related to sedation in this sample. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This research provides cross-sectional evidence to support age-, consumption-, and dependence/consequences-related differences in stimulatory alcohol responses among adolescents and young adults assessed within a bar-area context. While cross-sectional, the results of this field-based study provide support for the theory that addiction liability is developmentally linked and associated, in part, with age-related differences in subjective alcohol responses. </AbstractText>

RF and RHD both contribute towards increasing global burden of disease, especially in developing countries. RHD is one of the most common acquired heart diseases causing permanent damage to heart valves which ultimately leads to heart failure. In RHD, heart valve lesions are formed which are mediated by autoimmune reaction between streptococcal antigens (M protein and group A carbohydrate epitope GlcNAc) and heart tissues. On the other hand, inflammatory response generated by cytokines promotes chronicity of the disease. Varying concentrations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients and controls are reported and are also found to be associated with IL-10 gene polymorphism in RF/RHD patients. Although the effect of IL-10 gene polymorphism on the functionality of IL-10 is unknown, many investigations suggest an important role of IL-10 and its polymorphism in immune regulation and progression of disease in RF/RHD. This review summarizes the studies based on association of interleukin-10 with RHD in different populations to understand the role of IL-10 in susceptibility and pathogenesis of the disease. </AbstractText>

The qualitative changes in cytokine biosynthesis by circulating mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and its modulation by glycemic control were investigated. PBMCs were isolated from 39 patients and 25 controls. They were stimulated with purified ligands and heat-killed bacteria in the absence/presence of glucose and NLPR3 inflammasome ligands. Experiments were repeated after 3 and 6months. Cytokine production was measured in cell supernatants; pro-interleukin(IL)-1 ? was measured in cell lysates. Gene expression of IL-1? and activity of caspase-1 were measured as well. Adequate release of interleukin (IL)-1? was found in 42.9% of patients compared to 90% of controls (p: 0.0001). This was related with down-regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome since gene expression of IL-1? remained unaltered whereas both the ratio of IL-1? to the intracellular pro-IL-1? and the activity of caspase-1 was lower in patients than controls. Addition of glucose did not modify defective IL-1? production. IL-6 production was increased after stimulation with Pam3Cys, phytohemagglutinin and C. albicans. After proper glycemic control, release of IL-1? was increased and of IL-6 decreased; cells of patients with improved glycemic control responded better to LPS stimulation under increased concentrations of glucose. It is concluded that diabetes type 2 is characterized by defective production of IL-1? from circulating monocytes due to impaired activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased production of the anti-inflammatory IL-6. Defects are restored with proper glycemic control. </AbstractText>

For this, a pregnant rat model within different doses of cooking oil fumes (COFs) derived PM2.5 was established in pregnancy in our research. Our previous studies have showed that exposure to COFs-derived PM2.5 was related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the mechanisms of signaling pathways remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms induced by COFs-derived PM2.5 injury on umbilical cord blood vessels (UCs) in vitro. Exposure to COFs-derived PM2.5 resulted in changing the expression of eNOS, ET-1, ETRA, and ETRB. In additions, western blot analysis indicated that the HIF-1?/iNOS/NO signaling pathway and VEGF/VEGFR1/iNOS signaling pathway were involved in UCs injury triggered by COFs-derived PM2.5. In conclusion, our data suggested that exposure to COFs-derived PM2.5 resulted in increasing of oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as dysfunction of UCs. </AbstractText>

Investigations were conducted on 360 persons (mean age: 44.49±9.62years), workers exposed to lead compounds. The analysis examined four polymorphisms of BNP gene, i.e.,: rs198388, rs198389, rs632793, and rs6676300; as well as one polymorphism of receptor C for natriuretic peptides, i.e., rs1421811. Heterozygosity in locus rs632793 of NPPB gene may result in higher concentrations of Pb-B, while allele A in locus rs632793 of NPPB gene seems to determine higher concentrations of ZnPP in persons occupationally exposed to lead. Workers exposed to lead and carrying allele C in locus rs198388 of NPPB gene, particularly in the heterozygotic setup, seem to be predisposed to present higher concentrations of ZnPP. Carriership of A allele in locus rs198389 of NPPB gene probably determines higher concentrations of ZnPP in study group. In summary, among persons occupationally exposed to lead, certain relationships were demonstrated between rs632793, rs198388 and rs198389 polymorphisms of NPPB gene and principal toxicological parameters characterizing exposure to lead. </AbstractText>

Here, we synthesize insights from microbiological, medical, social, and economic sciences to provide known mechanisms of aerosolized transmissibility and identify knowledge gaps that limit emergency preparedness plans.

Since ROS exacerbate brain damage, it is important to protect neurons against their activity. Zinc finger protein 179 (Znf179) was shown to act as a neuroprotective factor, but the regulation of gene expression under oxidative stress remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated an increase in Znf179 protein levels in both in vitro model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced ROS accumulation and animal models of traumatic brain injury. Additionally, we examined the sub-cellular localization of Znf179, and demonstrated that oxidative stress increases Znf179 nuclear shuttling and its interaction with specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Subsequently, the positive autoregulation of Znf179 expression, which is Sp1-dependent, was further demonstrated using luciferase reporter assay and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Znf179-expressing cells and transgenic mice. The upregulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity induced by the treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) led to an increase in Znf179 levels, which further protected cells against H2O2-induced damage. However, Sp1 inhibitor, mithramycin A, was shown to inhibit NGF effects, leading to a decrease in Znf179 expression and lower cellular protection. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study show that Znf179 autoregulation through Sp1-dependent mechanism plays an important role in neuroprotection, and NGF-induced Sp1 signaling may help attenuate more extensive (ROS-induced) damage following brain injury. </AbstractText>

Ten national level male water polo players executed eggbeater kicks at maximum effort for the duration of the test. The eggbeater kick cycle was divided into four phases (FLX1, FLX2, EXT1, EXT2). Surface electromyographs were recorded from RF and BF. EMG activity normalized to the maximum voluntary isometric contraction, muscle co-activation (CCI) and angular velocity (AV) of the right and left knee were calculated. Highest levels of RCCI and LCCI were observed during final phase of flexion (FLX2) and initial phase of extension (EXT1) (p<0.05). FLX2 and final phase of extension (EXT2) revealed the highest AV during the cycle. A decrease in CCI was observed with fatigue for FLX2 while AV was reduced for all phases. During the cycle RF and BF act as agonist/antagonist to accelerate and decelerate knee flexion/extension. The high AV and low CCI levels observed for EXT2 might increase joint instability and consequent risk of injury. This knowledge provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stabilizing and controlling the knee during underwater movement. </AbstractText>

Reduced sensitivity of older muscles to respond to anabolic stimuli, i.e. anabolic resistance, is part of the underlying mechanisms. Although, muscle parameters have been studied in mice of various ages/strains; the aim was to study if mice display similar deteriorating processes as human ageing. Therefore, 10,16,21 and 25 months-old C57BL6/6J male mice were studied to measure parameters of sarcopenia and factors contributing to its pathophysiology, with the aim of characterizing sarcopenia in old mice. Muscle mass of the hind limb was lower in 25 as compared to 10 month-old mice. A significant decrease in physical daily activity, muscle grip strength and ex vivo muscle maximal force production was observed in 25 compared to 10 month-old mice. The muscle anabolic response to a single protein meal showed increased muscle protein synthesis in young, but not in old mice, indicative to anabolic resistance. However, by increasing the protein content in meals, anabolic resistance could be overcome, similar as in human elderly. Additionally, aged mice showed higher fasted insulin and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (=marker oxidative stress). This study shows clear characteristics of sarcopenia that coincide with anabolic resistance, insulin resistance and oxidative stress in 25 month-old C57/BL6 male mice, similar to human ageing. Furthermore, similar decline in muscle mass, strength and function was observed in this aged-mice-model. These observations offer potential for the future to explore in old mice the effects of interventions targeting sarcopenia. </AbstractText>

The effects of carriers on the drug solubility were assessed, and pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were plotted. Among the liquid SNEDDS formulations tested, the liquid SNEDDS composed of peceol (oil), Tween 20 (surfactant) and Labrasol (cosurfactant) at a weight ratio of 15/55/30, produced the smallest emulsion droplet size. The cilostazol-loaded liquid SNEDDS formulation was suspended in the distilled water and subjected to SPG membrane emulsification. Calcium silicate was added as a solid carrier in this liquid SNEDDS, completely suspended and spray-dried, leading to the production of a cilostazol-loaded solid SNEDDS. The emulsion droplet size, solubility and dissolution of the emulsified solid SNEDDS were assessed as compared to the solid SNEDDS prepared without emulsification. Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics and pharmacokinetics in rats were evaluated with the emulsified solid SNEDDS. The emulsified solid SNEDDS provided significantly smaller and more uniform nanoemulsions than did the non-emulsified solid SNEDDS. The emulsified solid SNEDDS showed significantly higher drug solubility and dissolution as compared to the non-emulsified solid SNEDDS. The crystalline drug in it was converted into the amorphous state. Moreover, in rats, it gave significantly higher initial plasma concentrations and AUC compared to the drug powder, suggesting its improved oral bioavailability of cilostazol.

Curcumin (CUR) and its analogs have gained widespread recognition due to their remarkable anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and wound healing activities. However, their pharmaceutical significance is limited due to inherent hydrophobic nature, poor water solubility, low bioavailability, chemical instability, rapid metabolism and short half-life. Owing to their pharmaceutical limitations, newer strategies have been attempted in recent years aiming to mitigate problems related to the effective delivery of curcumanoids and to improve their wound healing potential. These advanced strategies include nanovesicles, polymeric micelles, conventional liposomes and hyalurosomes, nanocomposite hydrogels, electrospun nanofibers, nanohybrid scaffolds, nanoconjugates, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), nanoemulsion, nanodispersion, and polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). The superior wound healing activities achieved after nanoencapsulation of the CUR are attributed to its target-specific delivery, longer retention at the target site, avoiding premature degradation of the encapsulated cargo and the therapeutic superiority of the advanced delivery systems over the conventional delivery. We have critically reviewed the literature and summarize the convincing evidence which explore the pharmaceutical significance and therapeutic feasibility of the advanced delivery systems in improving wound healing activities of the CUR and its analogs. </AbstractText>

Our main objective was to conduct an exploratory study on treatment dropout in a two-part web-based cognitive behavioral therapy with asynchronous therapeutic support. The analysis included 205 female patients with eating disorders. Reasons for dropout, treatment experiences, and predictors of dropout were analyzed. Overall treatment dropout was 37.6%, with 18.5% early dropout (before or during treatment part 1) and 19.0% late dropout (after part 1 or during part 2). Almost half of the participants identified personal circumstances as reason for dropout. The other participants mostly reported reasons related to the online delivery or treatment protocol. Predictors of early dropout included reporting less vigor and smoking at baseline and a longer average duration per completed treatment module of part 1. Late dropout was predicted by reporting less vigor at baseline and uncertainty about recommendation of the treatment to others after completion of treatment part 1. Generally, the web-based treatment and online therapeutic support were evaluated positively, although dropouts rated the treatment as significantly less helpful and effective than completers did. </AbstractText>

To better understand and prevent suicide within this population, we must identify mechanisms of risk contributing to these discrepancies. One risk factor relevant to military service is moral injury, a term for experiences that violate one's moral beliefs. Using a series of hierarchical multiple regressions, the current study examined the moderating role of post-deployment social support on the association between moral injury (self-transgressions, other-transgressions, and betrayal) and thwarted belongingness among military personnel. The current sample was comprised of 552 military personnel with at least one previous deployment. Partially consistent with hypotheses, results revealed that other-transgressions and betrayal were significantly associated with thwarted belongingness at low, but not mean or high levels of post-deployment support. In contrast, the interaction of self-transgressions and post-deployment support was not significantly associated with thwarted belongingness, nor was there a significant main effect of self-transgressions on thwarted belongingness. This suggests that experiencing other-perpetrated morally injurious events (i.e., watching a fellow soldier die, being betrayed by a comrade) can be compounded by low post-deployment social support, increasing risk for thwarted belongingness. Implications for prevention and treatment are discussed. </AbstractText>

Overall, 5361 respondents were included (mean age 50 years, 80% women). Compared with the persistently active, the persistently inactive, those decreasing and adopting LTPA had an increased risk for psychotropic medication. Only the persistently inactive remained at increased risk for psychotropic medication use, following the adjustment for prior psychotropic medication use. Compared with those having no medication, the risk for physical inactivity increased as the psychotropic medication increased. Our data suggest that physical activity has an important role in maintaining wellbeing and reducing psychotropic medication usage. </AbstractText>

27918972|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">The symptoms of schizophrenia might be mediated by a cortical network disconnection which may disrupt the cortical oscillatory activity. Steady-state responses are an easy and consistent way to explore cortical oscillatory activity. A chirp-modulated tone (increasing the frequency of the modulation in a linear manner) allows a fast measure of the steady-state response to different modulation rates. With this approach, we studied the auditory steady-state responses in two groups of patients with schizophrenia (drug-naive and treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs), in order to assess the differences in their responses with respect to healthy subjects, and study any potential effect of medication. Drug-naive patients had reduced amplitude and inter-trial phase coherence of the response in the 30-50Hz range, and reduced amplitude of the response in the 90-100Hz range, when compared to controls. In the treated patients group, the response in the 30-50Hz range was normalized to values similar to the control group, but the reduction in amplitude in the 90-100Hz range remained as in the drug-naive group. These results suggest that gamma activity impairment in schizophrenia is a complex phenomenon that affects a wide band of frequencies and may be influenced by antipsychotic treatment. </AbstractText>

The SBR performance had no evident change at 0-10 mg/L CuO NPs, whereas the CuO NPs concentration at 30-60 mg/L affected the COD, NH4(+)-N and soluble orthophosphate (SOP) removal, nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate and microbial enzymatic activity of activated sludge. Some CuO NPs might be absorbed on the surface of activated sludge or penetrate the microbial cytomembrane into the microbial cell interior of activated sludge. Compared to 0 mg/L CuO NPs, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release increased by 43.6% and 56.4% at 60 mg/L CuO NPs, respectively. The variations of ROS production and LDH release demonstrated that CuO NPs could induce the toxicity towards the microorganisms and destroy the integrity of microbial cytomembrane in the activated sludge. High throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA indicated that CuO NPs could evidently impact on the microbial richness, diversity and composition of activated sludge in the SBR. </AbstractText>

In fact, body mass index is more predictive of diabetes than any of the common risk alleles identified by genome-wide association studies. This discrepancy may be explained by epigenetic inheritance, whereby changes in gene regulation can be passed along to offspring. Epigenetic changes throughout an organism's lifetime, based on environmental factors such as chemical exposures, diet, physical activity, and age, can also affect gene expression and susceptibility to diabetes. Recently, novel genome-wide assays of epigenetic marks have resulted in a greater understanding of how genetics, epigenetics, and the environment interact in the development and inheritance of diabetes. </AbstractText>

It is also unclear whether great apes, as humans' nearest evolutionary relatives, have an aversion to inequitable resource distributions at all. Using a common methodology across species and child ages, the current two studies found that 3- and 4-year-old children (N=64) not only objected when they received less than a collaborative partner but also sacrificed to equalize when they received more. They did neither of these things in a nonsocial situation, demonstrating the fundamental role of social comparison. In contrast, chimpanzees (N=9) showed no aversion to inequitable distributions, only a concern for maximizing their own resources, with no differences between social and nonsocial conditions. These results underscore the unique importance for humans, even early in ontogeny, for treating others fairly, presumably as a way of becoming a cooperative member of one's cultural group. </AbstractText>

However, there is a lack of empirical research documenting the impact of self-evaluative emotion on 3- and 4-year-olds' prosociality. Extant research relates children's experiences of guilt to empathetic concern and making amends. However, the relationship between guilt and both concern and making amends is potentially reductive. Empathetic concern involves similar bodily expressions to guilt, and amend making is used to distinguish guilt from shame in children. This is the first study to relate the development of both positive and negative self-evaluative emotions to empathetic concern and prosocial choice (making amends and spontaneous help). Results confirm that the broad capacity for self-evaluative emotion is established during the preschool years and relates to empathetic concern. Moreover, these social emotions can be used to predict prosocial choice. Making amends was best predicted by empathetic concern and by children's responses to achievement (pride following success and lack of shame following failure). Alongside moral pride, pride in response to achievement and resilience to shame was also the best predictor of spontaneous help. The data support the idea that young children's prosocial choices may be partially driven by the affective drive to maintain an "ideal" self. Psychologists have emphasized that in order to be adaptive, self-evaluative emotion should be guilt oriented rather than shame oriented. However, the adaptive role of pride has been neglected. We call on future research to redress the focus on negative self-evaluation in moral development and further explore the prosocial potential of pride. </AbstractText>

The synthesized materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform inferred spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorption of the Zn(II) on the synthesized materials was highly dependent on the pH of the solution, the initial metal ion concentration, and temperature. The adsorption of Zn(II) on the studied materials was as follows: CS/Pani-Ppy>Pani-Ppy>Ppy>Pani>CS. The results reveal that adsorption of Zn(II) follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and that chemisorption occurs through pendant and bridging interactions, with active adsorbent sites. Thermodynamic results show the adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The synthesized materials show excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli and E. agglomerans bacterial organisms, and an approximately 100% decline in the viability of both strains was observed with CS/Pani-Ppy and Pani-Ppy. The order of antimicrobial activity for the synthesized materials was as follows: CS/Ppy-Pani>Ppy-Pani>Ppy>Pani>CS.

The synthetic approach involves the preparation of solid silica spheres with three-layer different structural silica containing the inner core of pure silica, middle layer of hybrid silica and outer shell of surfactant/SiO2 composite, followed by a hydrothermal treatment in hot water. The resulting products show a distinct rattle-like structure and spherical morphology. The average diameter, the shell thickness, and the solid core size of RMSNs are about 290, 35 and 90nm, respectively. During the etching process, the surfactant with different length of alkyl chain (CnTAB, e.g. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) in outer shell plays a decisive role for the formation of rattle-like structure. Benefiting from the residual amino groups in RMSNs, Au@RMSNs composites can be further constructed by in-situ generating Au nanoparticles into their hollow cavity, demonstrating an excellent catalytic performance for reduction of 4-nitrophenol.

Currently prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration is the most used prostate cancer marker, but it only shows limited specificity. Because PSA glycosylation is altered by prostate cancer, detecting glycosylation changes could increase PSA specificity as a prostate cancer marker. Changes in PSA glycosylation can modify its electrophoretic- behavior and techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) could be applied to detect changes in PSA glycosylation. Most serum PSA is complexed with alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT). To have access to most of the PSA, the complexed PSA has to be released as free PSA (fPSA); in addition, this total fPSA must be purified from the serum matrix so that it can be analyzed using CZE. In this work a methodology for isolating PSA from serum for its CZE analysis was established. By using PSA standard, the effect of this methodology, which combines conditions for dissociating complexed PSA and immunoaffinity chromatographic purification, was studied. It was seen that this highly repeatable sample treatment did not noticeably alter the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum or the CZE pattern of PSA standard. Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the developed sample treatment was applied to serum from a cancer patient with a high PSA content. The following observations can be made from these experiments: first of all, the 2-DE pattern of serum PSA remained unchanged after sample treatment; second, as hypothesized, the established sample preparation methodology made it possible to obtain the CZE pattern of PSA from serum; and third, the CZE pattern of serum PSA and of PSA standard from seminal plasma of healthy individuals, both submitted to the sample treatment method, showed some differences regarding the proportion of CZE peaks of the glycoprotein. These differences could be related to possible changes in the linkages of peptide backbone, in glycosylation or in other post-translational modifications between samples from both origins. </AbstractText>

In this study, the metabolism of FG-4592 was investigated in a human doping control sample and in five in vitro models: human hepatocytes and liver microsomes, equine liver microsomes and S9 fraction and the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

It is assumed that these interactions fix helix 7, thereby promoting a partial agonist conformation of the receptor. The theoretical considerations correlate very well with the results from the luciferase transactivation assay using hPPAR?-LBD as well as those from a time-resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay in which the coactivator (TRAP220, PGC-1?) recruitment and corepressor (NCoR1) release pattern was investigated. </AbstractText>

Phenylthiazole antibacterial agents have been extensively studied, by our group, as a potential novel class of antibiotics to circumvent the scourge of antibacterial resistance. Previously, the phenylthiazole lead compound 1 was shown to possess potent activity against clinical isolates of methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA). The promising activity of this novel class of antibiotics is hampered by their short half-life due to rapid hepatic metabolism. In the present study, a metabolic methylene soft spot in the lead 1 was identified and replaced with an oxygen atom. The newly developed phenylthiazoles, with alkoxy side chains, demonstrate high metabolic stability (t1/2 > 4 h), while maintaining their potent anti-MRSA activity. Furthermore, compound 5p demonstrated a selective advantage over vancomycin with its ability to kill intracellular MRSA. </AbstractText>

Two commercial polymers, poly(dimethylamine-coepichlorohydrin-coethylenediamine) (PDEHED) and poly(diallyl dimethyl amnmonium chloride) (PolyDADMAC) have been tested in the CP-UF process. The operating conditions (pH and polymer/As weight ratio) for As(V) complexation were determined finding values of 7.5/20 and 9.2/30 for PDEHED and polyDADMAC, respectively. The UF tests were performed by continuous diafiltration and diafiltration with volume reduction modes. The latter method permits to save the volume of washing solution during polymer regeneration. As(III) was not complexed, operating under the As(V) complexation conditions, thus a pre-oxidation step by using the photocatalytic approach was carried out to remove As(III) species. As(III) conversion to As(V) was evaluated by As speciation by using the CP-UF process for analytical purposes. Photocatalytic oxidation was successfully performed under UV radiation by using TiO2 (0.05 mg L(-1)), O2 and pH = 9. The oxidation was very fast during the first 10 min following a zero order kinetics (k = 0.83 mg L(-1) min(-1)) and reaching 90% As(III) oxidation. A conceptual scheme coupling photocatalysis and CP-UF and some criteria to operate the CP-UF process, useful to address it towards application, are reported. </AbstractText>

Moreover, heavy episodic (binge) drinking predicts more severe consequences. When examined by sexual orientation, highest rates of substance use have been found among bisexual individuals, with lower use at either end of the spectrum. When examined also by sex, this curvilinear trend is maintained among women but not men. These substance use patterns were identified using group differences (i.e. heterosexual vs. bisexual vs. homosexual). However, evidence suggests that sexual orientation is a continuous, not categorical, variable. This study examined the hypotheses that sexual orientation and commonly used substances (heavy episodic drinking, tobacco, marijuana) would have a quadratic relation among women, but not among men. Six negative binomial regressions tested study hypotheses using data from 7372 participants. Results indicated that sexual orientation had a quadratic relation with heavy episodic drinking, tobacco use, and marijuana use among women, as hypothesized. Additionally, a quadratic relation was found between marijuana use and sexual orientation among men. These findings indicate that women identifying as having mixed sexual orientation are at higher risk than women at either end of the sexual orientation continuum for substance use and related negative outcomes. For men, this is only true for marijuana use and resultant negative consequences. This observed increased use may relate to coping with increased stressors, which has been linked to more problematic use. By better understanding LBG identities and behaviors, clinicians and researchers will be more adept at identifying risk factors and better understanding the nuances across the sexual orientation spectrum. </AbstractText>

In this study, an analytical method, including extraction from complex environmental matrices, clean-up using solid phase extraction (SPE) and following-up derivatization prior to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), was developed to analyze seven commonly used bisphenols in sediment. Five kinds of extraction solvents, four kinds of SPE cartridges, and four kinds of SPE eluting solvents were individually tested for their performances; and the conditions for derivatizing were also optimized. Finally, C18 cartridge was determined as the SPE cartridge and methanol was selected as extracting and eluting solvent. Acetic anhydride (AA) was used as derivatizing agent and reaction took 20 min at room temperature. The method was used successfully to measure the seven bisphenol compounds in sediment samples from Taihu Lake, China. BPA, bisphenol F and bisphenol S were detected in all sediment samples, with concentrations in the range of 3.94-33.2; 0.503-3.28 and 0.323-27.3 ng g(-1) dw. Other compounds were detected at low frequencies or not detected.

Several attempts have been made to treat this disease; however, to date, there is no effective cure. Because of their antimicrobial activities, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most studied nanomaterial. Although the antiviral properties of AgNPs have been studied, their antiviral effect against viral infection in aquaculture has not been reported. The AgNPs tested herein are coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and possess multiple international certifications for their use in veterinary and human applications. The aim of this work was to evaluate the survival rate of juvenile white shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) after the intramuscular administration of AgNPs. For this, different concentrations of metallic AgNPs and PVP alone were injected into the organisms. After 96 h of administration, shrimp survival was more than 90% for all treatments. The oxygen consumption routine rate and total hemocyte count remained unaltered after AgNP injection, reflecting no stress caused. We evaluated whether AgNPs had an antiviral effect in shrimps infected with WSSV. The results revealed that the survival rate of WSSV-infected shrimps after AgNP administration was 80%, whereas the survival rate of untreated organisms was only 10% 96 h after infection. These results open up the possibility to explore the potential use of AgNPs as antiviral agents for the treatment of diseases in aquaculture organisms, particularly the WSSV in shrimp culture. </AbstractText>

Reported delinquent behaviors of children have reached an alarming level throughout all societies, and tend to be followed by further victimization. Victimized children suffer various physical and psychological difficulties, with the worst being further involved in perpetrations which puts these children at a greater risk. This study explores the transformation process from victimization to perpetration, by hypothesizing that depressive mood and anger serve as mediators. Data extracted from the Korean Child Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), of which the first wave (8th graders, n=2283) were used. Apart from depressive mood and anger, we included violent parenting and peer victimization to measure victimization, and for perpetration, conventional and cyber delinquent behaviors were s included in this model. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to test the hypothesis using Mplus, and bootstrapping method was used to test mediators while FIML was used to handle missing responses. The model yielded an appropriate fit including chi-square=391.477 (df=73, p< 0.001), CFI=0.968, TLI=0.954, RMSEA=0.044 (0.040-0.048). Specifically, anger was reported to be mediated in the relations between victimization and perpetration. Depressive mood was mediated in the relations between victimization and perpetration, except for the relation arising from parental victimization. The implications of these findings related to the transformation process and future research direction are discussed. </AbstractText>

Not only will a child move in with a new family, he or she may move to a different neighborhood, change schools, lose contact with old friends, be placed apart from one or more siblings, and have limited contact with his or her biological parents. The current study examined the impact of these transitions on foster children's adjustment to a new placement in out-of-home care. The sample consisted of 152 youth ages 6-17.5 who participated in the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) study and who were residing with relative or non-relative foster families at the time of the Wave I interview. During the Wave I interview, youth were asked to report on the types of transitions they experienced when they moved into their current placement. Linear and Poisson regressions were used to estimate the effect of the transitions on youths' relationships with their new families, mental health, relationships with peers at school, and school engagement. The results showed that youth whose biological mothers contacted them more than once a month had more symptoms of mental health problems than youth who had less contact with their biological mothers. In contrast, changing schools had a positive impact on youths' mental health, and youth who were separated from siblings were more likely to get along well with their school peers. Implications for improving youth's adjustment to new foster care placements are discussed. </AbstractText>

Disruptions of connectivity within this network have been associated with developmental dyslexia but their relation to individual differences in the severity of reading problems remains unclear. Here we investigate whether dysfunctional connectivity scales with the level of reading dysfluency by examining EEG recordings during visual word and false font processing in 9-year-old typically reading children (TR) and two groups of dyslexic children: severely dysfluent (SDD) and moderately dysfluent (MDD) dyslexics. Results indicated weaker occipital to inferior-temporal connectivity for words in both dyslexic groups relative to TRs. Furthermore, SDDs exhibited stronger connectivity from left central to right inferior-temporal and occipital sites for words relative to TRs, and for false fonts relative to both MDDs and TRs. Importantly, reading fluency was positively related with forward and negatively with backward connectivity. Our results suggest disrupted visual processing of words in both dyslexic groups, together with a compensatory recruitment of right posterior brain regions especially in the SDDs during word and false font processing. Functional connectivity in the brain's reading network may thus depend on the level of reading dysfluency beyond group differences between dyslexic and typical readers. </AbstractText>

However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and liver weight, food consumption, lipid content in serum and liver tissue, and liver dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-? and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse liver. Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-?, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing liver autophagy. </AbstractText>

Together with sample collection, an audit was performed to evaluate the implemented food safety management system and to investigate the specific audit requisites more associated to the occurrence of those L. monocytogenes serogroups frequently related with human disease. L. monocytogenes was present in 18% of the samples. The isolates (n=62) were serogrouped and detection of virulence-associated genes inlA, inlB, inlC and inlJ, and also plcA, hlyA, actA and iap was done by multiplex PCR. After this initial characterization, selected isolates (n=31) were submitted to antibiotic resistance testing by the disk diffusion method for the currently most used human and veterinary antibiotics and resistance was low. These isolates were also subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Genotyping and serogrouping of L. monocytogenes isolates revealed a genetically diverse population. Our data indicate that contamination of final products does not seem to be uniquely related to the sampled food surfaces. The occurrence of those L. monocytogenes serogroups more commonly associated with human disease in industries with a high hygienic audit classification could be the result of a previous identification of the pathogen, with an enforcement of the hygiene program without recognizing the real source of contamination. This reinforces the importance of a conjoined diagnosis using audit data and microbiological testing. Food safety management systems of those industries need improvement, particularly in cleaning and sanitizing operations, analytical control, preventive maintenance, personal hygiene and root cause analysis. </AbstractText>

A quantitative risk assessment from slaughter to consumption was carried out according to the Codex Alimentarius framework. In the hazard characterization, assumptions were made due to the lack of a dose-response relationship for oral exposure to hepatitis E virus (HEV). The prevalence of HEV in 160 pig livers of 40 different Swiss fattening farms was examined and determined to be 1.3% (CI 0.3%; 4.4%). This result was used as input in the risk assessment model, together with data from other published studies. The annual burden of hepatitis E was estimated in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), using data about hepatitis E cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 at two major hospitals located in the canton Ticino. Only the risk of foodborne hepatitis E from products containing pork liver was evaluated, as those containing only pork meat could not be evaluated because of lack of data on HEV load in pork. Assuming that successful oral infection occurs in 1% of servings contaminated with high HEV loads (>10(5) genome copies), and that acute illness develops in 5% of susceptible consumers, the most likely annual number of foodborne hepatitis E cases in Switzerland was estimated to be 1481 (95% CI 552; 4488) if all products containing pork liver were considered. If only high-risk products, such as plain pork liver and liver sausages (e.g. Saucisse au Foie), were considered, the annual number of cases was estimated to be 176 (95% CI 64; 498). We were unable to calculate the total burden of hepatitis E in Switzerland due to lack of data. Yet, for the canton Ticino, it was shown that a significant increase had occurred from <5 DALY per 100,000 inhabitants before 2012 to >50 DALY per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. This change could partly be due to an increased reporting and higher awareness among medical practitioners. Extrapolation to other regions could be accomplished if detailed information on food consumption patterns were available. Notification of HEV cases and attempts of cases source attribution would improve the basis for risk assessments. </AbstractText>

Many eu- and prokaryotic members of this class of monooxygenases display complex non-Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics, suggestive of homo-/heterotropic cooperativity arising from substrate-/effector-induced allosteric interactions. Here, the paradigm of multiple-ligand occupancy of the catalytic pocket in combination with enzyme oligomerization provides the most favored explanations for the atypical kinetic patterns. Making use of available data from crystallographic analyses, homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, the present review focuses on assessment of the topology of prospective key players dictating allosterism. Based on a general, CYP3A4-related construct, the majority of determinants were found to cluster within the six known substrate recognition sites (SRSs). Here, the B'/B'-C domains (SRS-1) and the F-helical region (SRS-2) harbor 51% of the critical residues, while SRS-4/5/6 each accommodate about 11-17% of the presumed docking spots. Of note, 12% of the total number of functional amino acids resides in non-SRS motifs. Average frequency of conservation of the allosteric sites examined was found to be fairly low (~13%), hinting at the requirement of some degree of conformational flexibility. Reactivity toward ligands coincides with the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity profile and bulkiness of the elements acting as selective filters. In sum, cooperative scenarios mainly pertain to regulative effects on substrate ingress, tuning of the open/closed equilibrium of the substrate access channel, modulation of the active-site capacity and productive ligand orientation toward the iron-oxene core. Deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of allostery may help avoid undesired drug-drug interplay in medicinal therapy and offer detoxification response to toxic agents. Finally, genetic manipulation of the cooperative machinery of P450s may provide a powerful tool in drug development. </AbstractText>

In addition to modulating IGF activities, IGFBP-2 interacts with a number of components of the extracellular matrix and cell membrane via a Cardin-Weintraub sequence or heparin binding domain (HBD1). The nature and the signalling elicited by these interactions are not fully understood. Here, we examined transgenic mice (H1d-hBP2) overexpressing a mutant human IGFBP-2 that lacks a specific heparin binding domain (HBD1) known as the Cardin-Weintraub sequence. H1d-hBP2 transgenic mice have the genetic background of FVB mice and are characterized by severe deficits in brain growth throughout their lifetime (p<0.05). In tissue lysates from brain hemispheres of 12-21day old male mice, protein levels of the GTPase dynamin-I were significantly reduced (p<0.01). Weight reductions were also found in distinct brain regions in two different age groups (12 and 80weeks). In the younger group, impaired weights were observed in the hippocampus (-34%; p<0.001), cerebellum (-25%; p<0.0001), olfactory bulb (-31%; p<0.05) and prefrontal cortex (-29%; p<0.05). At an age of 12weeks expression of myelin basic protein was reduced (p<0.01) in H1d-BP-2 mice in the cerebellum but not in the hippocampus. At 80weeks of age, weight reductions were similarly present in the cerebellum (-28%; p<0.001) and hippocampus (-31; p<0.05). When mice were challenged in the elevated plus maze, aged but not younger H1d-hBP2 mice displayed significantly less anxiety-like behaviour, which was also observed in a second transgenic mouse model overexpressing mouse IGFBP-2 lacking HBD1 (H1d-mBP2). These in vivo studies provide, for the first time, evidence for a specific role of IGFBP-2 in brain functions associated with anxiety and risk behaviour. These activities of IGFBP-2 could be mediated by the Cardin-Weintraub/HBD1 sequence and are altered in mice expressing IGFBP-2 lacking the HBD1. </AbstractText>

Nitroglycerin (NTG) administration provokes spontaneous migraine-like headaches and in rat, an increased sensitivity to the formalin test. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous regulator of glutamate activity and its analogues attenuate NTG-induced neuronal activation in the nucleus trigeminalis caudalis (NTC). The anti-hyperalgesic effect of KYNA analogue 1 (KYNA-A1) was investigated on animal models specific for migraine pain. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Rats made hyperalgesic by NTG administration underwent the plantar or orofacial formalin tests. The effect of KYNA-A1 was evaluated in terms of nocifensive behavior and of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and cytokines expression in areas involved in trigeminal nociception. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">KYNA-A1 abolished NTG-induced hyperalgesia in both pain models; NTG alone or associated to formalin injection induced an increased mRNA expression of CGRP, nNOS and cytokines in the trigeminal ganglia and central areas, which was reduced by KYNA-A1. Additionally, NTG caused a significant increase in nNOS immunoreactivity in the NTC, which was prevented by KYNA-A1. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Glutamate activity is likely involved in mediating hyperalgesia in an animal model specific for migraine.

Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca(2+)-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3) diffuses with a coefficient (~280 ?m(2) s(-1)) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 ?m. Consequently, IP3 is generally considered a "global" cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP3-evoked Ca(2+) puffs to monitor IP3 diffusing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a diffusion coefficient (?10 ?m(2) s(-1)) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that diffusion of IP3 in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP3 (<5 ?m) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP3 should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger. </AbstractText>

AMPK also suppresses inflammation. We found that pharmacological activation of AMPK rapidly inhibited the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly phosphorylated two residues (Ser(515) and Ser(518)) within the Src homology 2 domain of JAK1. Activation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect that required the presence of Ser(515) and Ser(518) and was abolished in cells lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser(515) and Ser(518) abolished AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by either the sIL-6R?/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively active V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK activators metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK activators in a range of diseases associated with enhanced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. </AbstractText>

In this study, we found that PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) expression and activity were elevated in gastric cancer cells with acquired CDDP resistance (AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP) compared with their parental cells. Inhibition of PAK4 or knockdown of PAK4 expression by specific siRNA (small interfering RNA)-sensitized CDDP-resistant cells to CDDP and overcome CDDP resistance. Combination treatment of LY294002 [the inhibitor of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B or PKB) pathway] or PD98509 {the inhibitor of MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] pathway} with PF-3758309 (the PAK4 inhibitor) resulted in increased CDDP efficacy compared with LY294002 or PD98509 alone. However, after the concomitant treatment of LY294002 and PD98509, PF-3758309 administration exerted no additional enhancement of CDDP cytotoxicity in CDDP-resistant cells. Inhibition of PAK4 by PF-3758309 could significantly suppress MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling in CDDP-resistant cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway while not MEK/ERK pathway could inhibit PAK4 activity in these cells. The in vivo results were similar with those of in vitro In conclusion, these results indicate that PAK4 confers CDDP resistance via the activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. PAK4 and PI3K/Akt pathways can reciprocally activate each other. Therefore, PAK4 may be a potential target for overcoming CDDP resistance in gastric cancer. </AbstractText>

Using [U-(13)C]ribose we have identified a novel glycoxidation adduct, 5-deoxy-5-desmethylpronyl-lysine, 'norpronyl-lysine', as well as numerous free ketones, acids and amino group reaction products. Glycation by R5P and ADPR proceeds rapidly with R5P generating a brown precipitate with PLL (poly-L-lysine) within hours. ssNMR (solid-state NMR) (13)C-(13)C COSY identifies several crosslinking adducts such as the newly identified norpronyl-lysine, in situ, from the glycating reaction of (13)C5-ribose with collagen.

Inhibition of tumour PKN activity has been explored as an oncology therapeutic approach, with a PKN3-targeted RNAi (RNA interference)-derived therapeutic agent in Phase I clinical trials. To better understand this important family of kinases, we performed detailed enzymatic characterization, determining the kinetic mechanism and lipid sensitivity of each PKN isoform using full-length enzymes and synthetic peptide substrate. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that PKN1-3 follows a sequential ordered Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism, where peptide substrate binding is preceded by ATP binding. This kinetic mechanism was confirmed by additional kinetic studies for product inhibition and affinity of small molecule inhibitors. The known lipid effector, arachidonic acid, increased the catalytic efficiency of each isoform, mainly through an increase in kcat for PKN1 and PKN2, and a decrease in peptide KM for PKN3. In addition, a number of PKN inhibitors with various degrees of isoform selectivity, including potent (Ki<10 nM) and selective PKN3 inhibitors, were identified by testing commercial libraries of small molecule kinase inhibitors. This study provides a kinetic framework and useful chemical probes for understanding PKN biology and the discovery of isoform-selective PKN-targeted inhibitors. </AbstractText>

As membrane-bound proteins, their topology is difficult to determine, and thus their structures are largely unknown. To help resolve this, we focused on the final enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, DHCR24 (3?-hydroxysterol ?24-reductase). Prediction programmes and previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding which regions of DHCR24 are associated with the membrane, although there was general agreement that this was limited to only the N-terminal portion. Here, we present biochemical evidence that in fact the majority of the enzyme is associated with the ER membrane. This has important consequences for the many functions attributed to DHCR24. In particular, those that suggest DHCR24 alters its localization within the cell should be reassessed in light of this new information. Moreover, we propose that the expanding database of post-translational modifications will be a valuable resource for mapping the topology of membrane-associated proteins, such as DHCR24, that is, flagging cytosolic residues accessible to modifying enzymes such as kinases and ubiquitin ligases. </AbstractText>

To date, research into the functions of caspase-2 has been hampered by an absence of reagents that can distinguish its activity from that of the downstream apoptotic caspase, caspase-3. Identification of protein substrates of caspase-2 that are efficiently cleaved within cells may also provide clues to the role of this protease. We used a yeast-based transcriptional reporter system to define the minimal substrate specificity of caspase-2. The resulting profile enabled the identification of candidate novel caspase-2 substrates. Caspase-2 cleaved one of these proteins, the cancer-associated transcription factor Runx1, although with relatively low efficiency. A fluorogenic peptide was derived from the sequence most efficiently cleaved in the context of the transcriptional reporter. This peptide, Ac-VDTTD-AFC, was efficiently cleaved by purified caspase-2 and auto-activating caspase-2 in mammalian cells, and exhibited better selectivity for caspase-2 relative to caspase-3 than reagents that are currently available. We suggest that this reagent, used in parallel with the traditional caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC, will enable researchers to monitor caspase-2 activity in cell lysates and may assist in the determination of stimuli that activate caspase-2 in vivo. </AbstractText>

The chloroplast F-ATP synthase (CF1FO-ATP synthase) of plants is integrated into the thylakoid membrane via its FO-domain subunits a, b, b' and c Subunit c with a stoichiometry of 14 and subunit a form the gate for H(+)-pumping, enabling the coupling of electrochemical energy with ATP synthesis in the F1 sector.Here we report the crystallization and structure determination of the c14-ring of subunit c of the CF1FO-ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts. The crystals belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=144.420, b=99.295, c=123.51 Å, and ?=104.34° and diffracted to 4.5 Å resolution. Each c-ring contains 14 monomers in the asymmetric unit. The length of the c-ring is 60.32 Å, with an outer ring diameter 52.30 Å and an inner ring width of 40 Å. </AbstractText>

The activity of Ero1? is tightly regulated through the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds to help ensure balanced ER redox conditions. Ero1? is less tightly regulated, but the molecular details underlying control of activity are not as well characterized as for Ero1?. Ero1? contains an additional cysteine residue (Cys(262)), which has been suggested to engage in an isoform-specific regulatory disulfide bond with Cys(100) However, we show that the two regulatory disulfide bonds in Ero1? are likely conserved in Ero1? (Cys(90)-Cys(130) and Cys(95)-Cys(100)). Molecular modelling of the Ero1? structure predicted that the side chain of Cys(262) is completely buried. Indeed, we found this cysteine to be reduced and partially protected from alkylation in the ER of living cells. Furthermore, mutation of Cys(100)-but not of Cys(262)-rendered Ero1? hyperactive in cells, as did mutation of Cys(130) Ero1? hyperactivity induced the UPR (unfolded protein response) and resulted in oxidative perturbation of the ER redox state. We propose that features other than a distinct pattern of regulatory disulfide bonds determine the loose redox regulation of Ero1? relative to Ero1?. </AbstractText>

(phosphoinositide 3-kinase ?) to its PM (plasma membrane) localized substrate is also required for increased levels of downstream PIP3/Akt [phosphoinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate/also called PKB (protein kinase B)] signalling. We have studied the subcellular localization of wild-type and the two most common oncogenic mutants of PI3K? in cells maintained in growth media, and starved or stimulated cells using a novel method in which PI3K? is pre-formed as a 1:1 p110?:p85? complex in vitro then introduced into live cells by microinjection. Oncogenic E545K and H1047R mutants did not constitutively interact with membrane lipids in vitro or in cells maintained in 10% (v/v) FBS. Following stimulation of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), microinjected PI3K? was recruited to the PM, but oncogenic forms of PI3K? were not recruited to the PM to a greater extent and did not reside at the PM longer than the wild-type PI3K?. Instead, the E545K mutant specifically bound activated Cdc42 in vitro and microinjection of E545K was associated with the formation of cellular protrusions, providing some preliminary evidence that changes in protein-protein interactions may play a role in the oncogenicity of the E545K mutant in addition to the well-known changes in lipid kinase activity. </AbstractText>

However, recurrence or persistence of the disease occurs in some cases associated with the presence of loco-regional or distant metastatic lesions that generally become resistant to radioiodine therapy, while glucose uptake and metabolism are increased. Recent advances in the field of tumor progression have shown that CTC (circulating tumour cells) are metabolic and genetically heterogeneous. There is now special interest in unravelling the mechanisms that allow the reminiscence of dormant tumour lesions that might be related to late disease progression and increased risk of recurrence. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated by the depletion in cellular energy levels and allows adaptive changes in cell metabolism that are fundamental for cell survival in a stressful environment; nevertheless, the activation of this kinase also decreases cell proliferation rate and induces tumour cell apoptosis. In the thyroid field, AMPK emerged as a novel important intracellular pathway, since it regulates both iodide and glucose uptakes in normal thyroid cells. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the AMPK pathway is highly activated in papillary thyroid carcinomas, although the clinical significance of these findings remains elusive. Herein we review the current knowledge about the role of AMPK activation in thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, with special focus on thyroid cancer. </AbstractText>

MUC (mucin) 5AC is an important component of the airway mucus. The formation of MUC5AC is related to ATP and intracellular calcium in the epithelial cells. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ATP release from intracellular calcium in epithelial cells on cyclic pressure-induced mucus secretion in the airway. 16HBE (human bronchial epithelial cells) were cultured in vitro on cyclically tilted cultured plates and divided into five groups: control, tilt, tilt and BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester), tilt and EGTA and tilt and RB-2 (reactive blue-2). The shear stress and compressive stress were induced by the surface tension of the liquid, atmospheric pressure and liquid gravity. Cell activity, MUC5AC mRNA expression level, MUC5AC protein expression level and ATP release and intracellular calcium changes were measured with the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR), HPLC and inverted fluorescence microscope, respectively. We detected that cyclic pressure significantly increased MUC5AC secretion and ATP release. The enhanced ATP release could be inhibited by both BAPTA-AM and RB-2, while EGTA did not have a suppressive effect. BAPTA-AM, EGTA and RB-2 did not obviously inhibit MUC5AC mRNA expression. Cyclic pressure did not induce MUC5AC secretion in the airway mucus epithelium via Ca(2+)-dependent ATP release, and nearly all Ca(2+) was provided by stored intracellular Ca(2). </AbstractText>

Hereby, a critical step in stromal function is the transition of tumour-associated fibroblasts to MFs (myofibroblasts) by growth factors, for example TGF? (transforming growth factor beta(). In this study, the question was addressed of whether fibroblast-associated NAD(P)H oxidase (NADH/NADPH oxidase), known to be activated by TGF?1, is involved in the fibroblast-to-MF switch. The up-regulation of ?SMA (alpha smooth muscle actin), a biomarker for MFs, is mediated by a TGF?1-dependent increase in the intracellular level of ROS (reactive oxygen species). This report demonstrates two novel aspects of the TGF?1 signalling cascade, namely the generation of ROS due to a biphasic NAD(P)H oxidase activity and a ROS-dependent downstream activation of p38 leading to a transition of dermal fibroblasts to MFs that can be inhibited by the selective NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin. These data suggest that inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity prevents the fibroblast-to-MF switch and may be important for chemoprevention in context of a 'stromal therapy' which was described earlier. </AbstractText>

DCIS is heterogeneous in several ways, such as its clinical presentation, morphology and genomic profile. Excellent outcomes have been reported; however, many questions remain unanswered. For example, which patients groups are overtreated and could instead benefit from minimal intervention and which patient groups require a more traditional multidisciplinary approach. The development of a comprehensive integrated analysis that includes the radiological, morphological and genetic aspects of DCIS is necessary to answer these questions. This review focuses on discussing the significant findings about the morphological and molecular features of DCIS and its progression that have helped to uncover the biological and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. The knowledge gained in recent years might allow the development of tailored clinical management for women with DCIS in the future. </AbstractText>

By comparing two different inhibitors of the Rsk (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) kinases, we found that the increasingly used compound BI-D1870 had biological effects in murine DCs (dendritic cells) that could not be solely ascribed to Rsk or other documented targets. We assessed the ability of BI-D1870 and a second Rsk inhibitor, BIX 02565 to protect enzyme active sites from reaction with biotinylated nucleotide acyl phosphates. Using SILAC (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture)-labelled DC lysates as a source of enzyme targets, we identify several kinases that interact with BI-D1870 but not with BIX 02565. We confirmed that these kinases, including Slk, Lok and Mst1, are inhibited by BI-D1870 but to a much lesser extent by BIX 02565 and that phosphorylation of some of their substrates is blocked by BI-D1870 in living cells. Our results suggest that the BI-D1870 inhibitor should be used with caution. The SILAC-based methodology we used should be useful for further comparative unbiased profiling of the target spectrum of kinase inhibitors with interesting biological effects under conditions that closely mimic those found in cells. </AbstractText>

We have previously proposed that pathophysiological perturbations in lysosomal function may inhibit intracellular Cbl transport with consequences for down-stream metabolic pathways. In the current study, we used both HT1080 fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y neurons to assess the impact that protease inhibitors, chloroquine and leupeptin (N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-argininal), have on the distribution of [(57)Co]Cbl in lysosomes, mitochondria and cytosol. Under standard cell culture conditions the distribution of [(57)Co]Cbl in both neurons and fibroblasts was ~5% in lysosomes, 14% in mitochondria and 81% in cytosol. Treatment of cells with either 25 ?M chloroquine or 40 ?M leupeptin for 48 h significantly increased the lysosomal [(57)Co]Cbl levels, by 4-fold in fibroblasts and 10-fold in neurons, and this was associated with reduced cytosolic and mitochondrial [(57)Co]Cbl concentrations. Based on Western blotting of LAMP2 in fractions recovered from an OptiPrep density gradient, lysosomal Cbl trapping was associated with an expansion of the lysosomal compartment and an increase in a subpopulation of lysosomes with increased size and density. Moreover, the decreased mitochondrial Cbl that was associated with lysosomal Cbl trapping was correlated with decreased incorporation of [(14)C] propionate into cellular proteins/macromolecules, indicating an inhibition of Cbl-dependent Mm-CoA (methylmalonyl-coenzyme A) mutase activity. These results add support to the idea that lysosomal dysfunction may significantly impact upon Cbl transport and utilization. </AbstractText>

As an important member of monounsaturated fatty acids, oleate, together with other components, is widely used to induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. However, it is not clear whether oleate alone can induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. In the present study, four different treatments were designed to test this question: basal medium, IDX [insulin, dexamethasone and IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine)], oleate and IDX plus oleate. Cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation and mRNA expression for adipogenesis-related genes were monitored. After treatment of oleate on chicken preadipocytes, apparent lipid droplet formation and lipid accumulation were observed, accompanied by increasing expression of PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?) and AFABP (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein), but decreasing level of GATA2 (GATA-binding protein 2). In contrast, for cells cultured in the basal medium with or without IDX supplementation, lipid droplet barely occurred. These results suggest that exogenous oleate alone can act as an inducer of preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. </AbstractText>

The diagnosis of stroke, its underlying aetiology, theranostic strategies, recurrence risk and path to recovery are populated by a series of highly individualised questions. Moreover, the phenotypic complexity of a clinical diagnosis of stroke makes a simple genetic risk assessment only partially informative on an individual basis. The guiding principles of precision medicine in stroke underscore the need to identify, value, organise and analyse the multitude of variables obtained from each individual to generate a precise approach to optimise cerebrovascular health. Existing data may be leveraged with novel technologies, informatics and practical clinical paradigms to apply these principles in stroke and realise the promise of precision medicine. Importantly, precision medicine in stroke will only be realised once efforts to collect, value and synthesise the wealth of data collected in clinical trials and routine care starts. Stroke theranostics, the ultimate vision of synchronising tailored therapeutic strategies based on specific diagnostic data, demand cerebrovascular expertise on big data approaches to clinically relevant paradigms. This review considers such challenges and delineates the principles on a roadmap for rational application of precision medicine to stroke and cerebrovascular health. </AbstractText>

Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase.

Approaches have been developed for designing self-assembling structures consisting of either nucleic acids or proteins, but strategies for engineering hybrid biological materials are only beginning to emerge. Here we describe the design of self-assembling protein nanocages that direct their own release from human cells inside small vesicles in a manner that resembles some viruses. We refer to these hybrid biomaterials as 'enveloped protein nanocages' (EPNs). Robust EPN biogenesis requires protein sequence elements that encode three distinct functions: membrane binding, self-assembly, and recruitment of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. A variety of synthetic proteins with these functional elements induce EPN biogenesis, highlighting the modularity and generality of the design strategy. Biochemical analyses and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that one design, EPN-01, comprises small (~100?nm) vesicles containing multiple protein nanocages that closely match the structure of the designed 60-subunit self-assembling scaffold. EPNs that incorporate the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein can fuse with target cells and deliver their contents, thereby transferring cargoes from one cell to another. These results show how proteins can be programmed to direct the formation of hybrid biological materials that perform complex tasks, and establish EPNs as a class of designed, modular, genetically-encoded nanomaterials that can transfer molecules between cells. </AbstractText>

These contributions are profoundly heterogeneous but may converge on common pathways that are not yet well understood. Here, through post-mortem genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the largest cohort of samples analysed so far, to our knowledge, we interrogate the noncoding transcriptome, alternative splicing, and upstream molecular regulators to broaden our understanding of molecular convergence in ASD. Our analysis reveals ASD-associated dysregulation of primate-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), downregulation of the alternative splicing of activity-dependent neuron-specific exons, and attenuation of normal differences in gene expression between the frontal and temporal lobes. Our data suggest that SOX5, a transcription factor involved in neuron fate specification, contributes to this reduction in regional differences. We further demonstrate that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, chromosome 15q11.2-13.1 duplication syndrome (dup15q), shares the core transcriptomic signature observed in idiopathic ASD. Co-expression network analysis reveals that individuals with ASD show age-related changes in the trajectory of microglial and synaptic function over the first two decades, and suggests that genetic risk for ASD may influence changes in regional cortical gene expression. Our findings illustrate how diverse genetic perturbations can lead to phenotypic convergence at multiple biological levels in a complex neuropsychiatric disorder. </AbstractText>

Recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species. Whether pairwise loops synergize to form higher-order structures is still unclear. Here we develop a conformation capture assay to study higher-order organization using chromosomal walks (C-walks) that link multiple genomic loci together into proximity chains in human and mouse cells. This approach captures chromosomal structure at varying scales. Inter-chromosomal contacts constitute only 7-10% of the pairs and are restricted by interfacing TADs. About half of the C-walks stay within one chromosome, and almost half of those are restricted to intra-TAD spaces. C-walks that couple 2-4 TADs indicate stochastic associations between transcriptionally active, early replicating loci. Targeted analysis of thousands of 3-walks anchored at highly expressed genes support pairwise, rather than hub-like, chromosomal topology at active loci. Polycomb-repressed Hox domains are shown by the same approach to enrich for synergistic hubs. Together, the data indicate that chromosomal territories, TADs, and intra-TAD loops are primarily driven by nested, possibly dynamic, pairwise contacts. </AbstractText>

ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several chromatin remodelling complexes, which mobilize nucleosomes along genomic DNA, promoting replication progression, transcription repression, heterochromatin formation, and many other nuclear processes. The ATPase motor of ISWI is an autonomous remodelling machine, whereas its carboxy (C)-terminal HAND-SAND-SLIDE (HSS) domain functions in binding extranucleosomal linker DNA. The activity of the catalytic core of ISWI is inhibited by the regulatory AutoN and NegC domains, which are in turn antagonized by the H4 tail and extranucleosomal DNA, respectively, to ensure the appropriate chromatin landscape in cells. How AutoN and NegC inhibit ISWI and regulate its nucleosome-centring activity remains elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of ISWI from the thermophilic yeast Myceliophthora thermophila and its complex with a histone H4 peptide. Our data show the amino (N)-terminal AutoN domain contains two inhibitory elements, which collectively bind the second RecA-like domain (core2), holding the enzyme in an inactive conformation. The H4 peptide binds to the core2 domain coincident with one of the AutoN-binding sites, explaining the ISWI activation by H4. The H4-binding surface is conserved in Snf2 and functions beyond AutoN regulation. The C-terminal NegC domain is involved in binding to the core2 domain and functions as an allosteric element for ISWI to respond to the extranucleosomal DNA length. </AbstractText>

Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are relatively common, with an estimated 778 affected children born each year in the United States. Mitochondrial replacement therapies or techniques (MRT) circumventing mother-to-child mtDNA disease transmission involve replacement of oocyte maternal mtDNA. Here we report MRT outcomes in several families with common mtDNA syndromes. The mother's oocytes were of normal quality and mutation levels correlated with those in existing children. Efficient replacement of oocyte mutant mtDNA was performed by spindle transfer, resulting in embryos containing >99% donor mtDNA. Donor mtDNA was stably maintained in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) derived from most embryos. However, some ES cell lines demonstrated gradual loss of donor mtDNA and reversal to the maternal haplotype. In evaluating donor-to-maternal mtDNA interactions, it seems that compatibility relates to mtDNA replication efficiency rather than to mismatch or oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. We identify a polymorphism within the conserved sequence box II region of the D-loop as a plausible cause of preferential replication of specific mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, some haplotypes confer proliferative and growth advantages to cells. Hence, we propose a matching paradigm for selecting compatible donor mtDNA for MRT. </AbstractText>

Alterations in developmental pathways have been associated with declines in stem-cell function during ageing, but the nature of this process remains poorly understood. Hox genes are key regulators of stem cells and tissue patterning during embryogenesis with an unknown role in ageing. Here we show that the epigenetic stress response in muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells) differs between aged and young mice. The alteration includes aberrant global and site-specific induction of active chromatin marks in activated satellite cells from aged mice, resulting in the specific induction of Hoxa9 but not other Hox genes. Hoxa9 in turn activates several developmental pathways and represents a decisive factor that separates satellite cell gene expression in aged mice from that in young mice. The activated pathways include most of the currently known inhibitors of satellite cell function in ageing muscle, including Wnt, TGF?, JAK/STAT and senescence signalling. Inhibition of aberrant chromatin activation or deletion of Hoxa9 improves satellite cell function and muscle regeneration in aged mice, whereas overexpression of Hoxa9 mimics ageing-associated defects in satellite cells from young mice, which can be rescued by the inhibition of Hoxa9-targeted developmental pathways. Together, these data delineate an altered epigenetic stress response in activated satellite cells from aged mice, which limits satellite cell function and muscle regeneration by Hoxa9-dependent activation of developmental pathways. </AbstractText>

Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in ?-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (?)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing ?-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in ?-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on ?-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in ?-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local ?-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the ?-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the ?-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification. </AbstractText>

Such a state of matter is potentially relevant to high-temperature superconductivity and quantum-information applications, and experimental identification of a quantum spin liquid state is of fundamental importance for our understanding of quantum matter. Theoretical studies have proposed various quantum-spin-liquid ground states, most of which are characterized by exotic spin excitations with fractional quantum numbers (termed 'spinons'). Here we report neutron scattering measurements of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet YbMgGaO4 that reveal broad spin excitations covering a wide region of the Brillouin zone. The observed diffusive spin excitation persists at the lowest measured energy and shows a clear upper excitation edge, consistent with the particle-hole excitation of a spinon Fermi surface. Our results therefore point to the existence of a quantum spin liquid state with a spinon Fermi surface in YbMgGaO4, which has a perfect spin-1/2 triangular lattice as in the original proposal of quantum spin liquids. </AbstractText>

Langerhans cells (LCs) belong to the subset of dendritic cells (DCs) that line the mucosal epithelia of vagina and foreskin and have the ability to sense and induce immunity to invading pathogens. Anatomical and functional characteristics make LCs one of the primary targets of HIV-1 infection. Notably, LCs form a protective barrier against HIV-1 infection and transmission. LCs restrict HIV-1 infection through the capture of HIV-1 by the C-type lectin receptor Langerin and subsequent internalization into Birbeck granules. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV-1 restriction in LCs remains unknown. Here we show that human E3-ubiquitin ligase tri-partite-containing motif 5? (TRIM5?) potently restricts HIV-1 infection of LCs but not of subepithelial DC-SIGN(+) DCs. HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5? was thus far considered to be reserved to non-human primate TRIM5? orthologues, but our data strongly suggest that human TRIM5? is a cell-specific restriction factor dependent on C-type lectin receptor function. Our findings highlight the importance of HIV-1 binding to Langerin for the routeing of HIV-1 into the human TRIM5?-mediated restriction pathway. TRIM5? mediates the assembly of an autophagy-activating scaffold to Langerin, which targets HIV-1 for autophagic degradation and prevents infection of LCs. By contrast, HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN(+) DCs leads to disassociation of TRIM5? from DC-SIGN, which abrogates TRIM5? restriction. Thus, our data strongly suggest that restriction by human TRIM5? is controlled by C-type-lectin-receptor-dependent uptake of HIV-1, dictating protection or infection of human DC subsets. Therapeutic interventions that incorporate C-type lectin receptors and autophagy-targeting strategies could thus provide cell-mediated resistance to HIV-1 in humans. </AbstractText>

The mammalian mRNA m(6)A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer (Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However, the functions of m(6)A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain uncertain. Here we show that m(6)A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness. This is because m(6)A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We further show that the m(6)A reader protein YT521-B decodes m(6)A in the sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. Loss of m(6)A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly in the 5' untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of metabolic genes. The requirement of m(6)A and its reader YT521-B for female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels of gene expression. </AbstractText>

Compared with placebo or no treatment, vitamin D was associated with decreased mortality; however, benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded. Vitamin D treatment was associated with a possible decreased risk for at least 1 fall and the total number of falls per person but not for fractures.

The little available evidence suggests that previewing the target produces larger reductions in search times for harder searches. To investigate this issue further, we performed seven experiments in which subjects searched for an oddball target after previewing the target, distracter, or an unrelated square. Consistent with previous studies, harder searches showed bigger reductions in search time for an informative preview. However, the same data replotted using the reciprocal of search time showed a remarkably different result: The informative preview showed a fixed additive increase in reciprocal search time across all searches regardless of difficulty. This is a nontrivial outcome because it cannot be explained using a simple relationship between search times in the informative and uninformative preview conditions. We interpret our findings by proposing that the reciprocal of search time reflects the strength of an underlying accumulating signal related to the distinctiveness or salience of the target over the distracters and that preview additively increases this signal for all searches. This in turn implies that the top-down signals related to target preview and bottom-up signals related to target-distracter salience sum linearly. </AbstractText>

In the present study, using a similar experimental procedure, this result was confirmed. It was also established that combining the translational optical flow with simulated head oscillations (similar to those during natural walking) improved the subjects' perception of the distance travelled in comparison with a purely translational flow. This improvement may be attributable to the fact that an optic flow pattern resembling that associated with walking enhances the path integration process. In a subsequent experiment, we investigated whether it was the biological or the rhythmical characteristics of the simulation that enhanced the subjects' estimates of the distance travelled. The results obtained confirm that adding rhythmic components to the optic flow pattern improved the accuracy of subjects' perception of the distance travelled. However, no significant differences between biological and rhythmical oscillations were detected. These results relate to recent studies on the effects of smooth and jittering optic flows on vection onset and strength. One possible conclusion is that oscillations may increase the global retinal motion and thus improve the vection and path integration processes. Another possibility is that the nonmonotonous pattern of retinal motion induced by oscillatory inputs may maintain optimum sensitivity to the optic flow over time and thus improve the accuracy of subjects' perception of the distance travelled. </AbstractText>

Field expansion devices (e.g., prisms) can create artificial peripheral islands of vision. We investigated the visual angle at which these islands can be most effective for avoiding pedestrian collisions, by modeling the collision risk density as a function of bearing angle of pedestrians relative to the patient. Pedestrians at all possible locations were assumed to be moving in all directions with equal probability within a reasonable range of walking speeds. The risk density was found to be highly anisotropic. It peaked at ?45° eccentricity. Increasing pedestrian speed range shifted the risk to higher eccentricities. The risk density is independent of time to collision. The model results were compared to the binocular residual peripheral island locations of 42 patients with forms of retinitis pigmentosa. The natural residual island prevalence also peaked nasally at about 45° but temporally at about 75°. This asymmetry resulted in a complementary coverage of the binocular field of view. Natural residual binocular island eccentricities seem well matched to the collision-risk density function, optimizing detection of other walking pedestrians (nasally) and of faster hazards (temporally). Field expansion prism devices will be most effective if they can create artificial peripheral islands at about 45° eccentricities. The collision risk and residual island findings raise interesting questions about normal visual development. </AbstractText>

Flavonoids show promising activity as natural plant-based antioxidants due to their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. However, their primary applications as antioxidants in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries are limited because of their moderately hydrophilic nature. Enzymatic acylation of natural polyphenols with fatty acids or other acyl donors has been suggested for improving the lipophilic nature of the glycosylated flavonoids. This approach increases flavonoid solubility and stability in lipophilic systems. Acylation of flavonoids with different acyl donors may also introduce beneficial properties to the molecule, such as penetration through the cell membrane and improved antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, cytogenetic, and enzyme inhibition activities. Chemical methods for the synthesis of flavonoid esters lead to the formation of side products and the simultaneous decomposition of the flavonoids due to harsh reaction conditions. In contrast, biocatalytic acylation of flavonoids by lipases offers advantages associated to the wide availability of these enzymes, their low cost, chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, mild condition processing and non-requirement of cofactors. This article is focused on the recent development of lipase-catalyzed synthesis of flavonoid esters and the impact of the acylation reaction on their biological activities. </AbstractText>

However, the correlation with flap weight is unknown. Here, we explore the relationship of flap weights and complication rates in patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction. Methods?Retrospective chart review identified all patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction with abdominally based flaps at a single institution between November 2007 and April 2013. Breasts with documented flap weight and 1-year follow-up were included. Patients undergoing stacked deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps were excluded. Breasts were divided into quartiles based on flap weight and examined by demographics, surgical characteristics, complications, and revisions. Results?A total of 130 patients undergoing 225 flaps were identified. Patients had a mean age of 50.4 years, mean BMI of 27.1 kg/m(2), and mean flap weight of 638.4?g (range: 70-1640 g). Flap weight and BMI were directly correlated. Flaps were divided into weight-based quartiles: first (70-396 g), second (397-615 g), third (616-870 g), and fourth (871-1640 g). There were no associations between flap weight and incidences of venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, hematoma, flap loss, fat necrosis, or donor site hernia. However, increased flap weight was associated with increased rate of donor site wound healing problems in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Conclusions?Increased flap weight is not associated with added flap complications among patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction, however, patients with flaps of 667.5?g or more are more likely to have donor site healing problems. The success and evidence contrary to previous studies may be attributed to surgeon intraoperative flap choice. </AbstractText>

27919114|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Background?The surgical microscope is still essential for microsurgery, but several alternatives that show promising results are currently under development, such as endoscopes and laparoscopes with video systems; however, as yet, these have only been used for arterial anastomoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a low-cost video-assisted magnification system in replantation of the hindlimbs of rats. Methods?Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into two matched groups according to the magnification system used: the microscope group, with hindlimb replantation performed under a microscope with an image magnification of 40× and the video group, with the procedures performed under a video system composed of a high-definition camcorder, macrolenses, a 42-in television, and a digital HDMI cable. The camera was set to 50× magnification. We analyzed weight, arterial and venous caliber, total surgery time, arterial and venous anastomosis time, patency immediately and 7 days postoperatively, the number of stitches, and survival rate. Results?There were no significant differences between the groups in weight, arterial or venous caliber, or the number of stitches. Replantation under the video system took longer (p?<?0.05). Patency rates were similar between groups, both immediately and 7 days postoperatively. Conclusion?It is possible to perform a hindlimb replantation in rats through video system magnification, with a satisfactory success rate comparable with that for procedures performed under surgical microscopes. </AbstractText>

Refractory status epilepticus or a cluster of seizures start a few days after the onset of an acute febrile illness; however, encephalitis cannot be proved. Sequelae of FIRES are drug-resistant epilepsy and neuropsychological impairments occurring without latency. Clinical knowledge is limited because FIRES is sporadic and extremely rare. Therefore, based on literature and our data, this review includes clinical features, terminology, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria and procedures, differential diagnoses, acute and chronic therapeutic options, and outcome data. Particular attention is paid to the epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that FIRES is an immune but not an autoimmune disease and discuss GABAergic therapy at high doses, avoidance of burst-suppression coma, and early introduction of enteral or even parenteral ketogenic diet as the most promising treatment. The lack of evidence requires both a network and a multinational web-based clinical registry to define the clinical spectrum for improving diagnosis and treatment and at the very least, to clarify the cause of FIRES. We conclude that the term "fulminant inflammatory response epilepsy syndrome" may be more appropriate. </AbstractText>

Stylohyoid complex has merely been described as cases of glossopharyngeal neuralgia in children. Case Report?A 12-year-old boy came to our hospital because of recurrent episodes of severe cranial pain (9/10) lasting for 5 to 15 minutes. Pain affected the right tonsillar fossa, ear, and mastoid region. Since the start at the age of 9 years, the frequency of painful episodes has progressively increased: when admitted to our clinics 3 years later, the child was having up to five episodes daily in spite of analgesic, antiepileptic, and antidepressant drugs; he had abandoned school and leisure. Between episodes, neurological examination detected only discomfort to pressure on the right tonsillar fossa. Three-dimensional computed tomography images of the skull base showed an elongated right styloid process and bilateral calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. After surgical excision of the right styloid process and of part of the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal painful episodes ceased. The patient remains asymptomatic seven years later. Conclusion?In spite of its rarity in childhood, this debilitating but treatable syndrome should be kept in mind for the differential diagnosis of recurrent cranial pain in the pediatric population. </AbstractText>

Evidence supporting the use of noninvasive NAVA is less robust, especially in the very low birth weight (VLBW) population. Objective?To determine whether synchronized noninvasive ventilation via neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV NAVA) supports ventilation postextubation in premature infants. Methods?A retrospective analysis of a cohort of twenty-four former VLBW (<1.5 kg) infants from July 2011 to October 2012. Decreased or unchanged capillary pCO2 after increasing NAVA support was used as a marker for adequately supported noninvasive ventilation. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-NAVA intervention (??=?0.05). Results?Ventilation improved after an increase in NIV NAVA level in 83% of the premature infants studied (20/24) with a decrease in median pCO2 by 5?mm Hg (p?=?0.0001). Conclusion?NIV NAVA can provide synchronized postextubation ventilatory support as measured by decreased pCO2 in premature infants. </AbstractText>

The objective of our study was to test the hypothesis that preeclampsia, an antiangiogenic state, is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Design?Prospective cohort study of infants less than 32 weeks' gestation born to mothers with preeclampsia between January 2007 and June 2010 at a single tertiary care center. Their BPD outcome was compared with infants born to the next two normotensive mothers with a?±?1?week gestational age difference. BPD was defined as oxygen dependency at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Multivariable binary regression was used to estimate the risk ratio (RR) of BPD with preeclampsia exposure and adjust for confounders. Results?Of 102 infants in the preeclampsia group, 23 (23%) developed BPD and of the 217 infants in the normotensive group, 56 (26%) developed BPD. On multivariable binary regression modeling, preeclampsia was not a risk factor for development of BPD (RR: 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-1.20). Surfactant use, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension-II score, sepsis, blood transfusion, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were significant risk factors for BPD. Conclusion?In our cohort, preeclampsia was not a significant risk factor for BPD. IUGR infants of preeclamptic and normotensive mothers were at higher risk for BPD. </AbstractText>

Most histologies report clefts between the cartilage and bone and necrotic areas. Several classifications have been published based on observations from imaging techniques or on intraoperative findings. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Imaging techniques are of great importance: X-rays of the ankle joint enable a quick diagnostic overview. MRT is the imaging-technique of choice for diagnosing OCDT-lesions. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of retrospective publications exist. Only a few are classified as level I or II papers. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. Adults do not profit from a longer conservative procedure. Where surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage of the lesion and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures or transchondral drilling are to be favoured. Where the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used: while techniques such as drilling and microfracturing, or matrix-associated microfracturing produces repair cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. Regarding the outcome, it is difficult to make a precise, scientifically-based recommendation which has been confirmed by more than one prospective study. Only limited recommendations are possible: In juveniles with intact cartilage, initially conservative treatment is indicated. If there is no improvement, conservative invasive techniques such as drilling may help. In adults conservative therapy should be limited to a few weeks. Regarding the surgical treatment options, there is a tendency towards better results with procedures which reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend towards better long-term results when co-morbidities are treated. Severe grades of osteoarthrosis are rare. </AbstractText>

Case 1 had a good postoperative course with intermittent self-catheterization after removal of urethral catheter. However, she died of cerebral hemorrhage during hospitalization. Although case 2 needed an indwelling urethral catheter due to the difficulty of intermittent self-catheterization, she had no recurrence of rupture for six months after the operation.

When she was 70 years old,an operation for her pelvic organ prolapse was performed. She visited our hospital because of discomfort in urination. We performed a transurethral lithotripsy of the bladder stone and detected a foreign body,and it was an anchor used for the Tissue Fixation System(TFS)operation (a pelvic organ prolapse operation).

The component of the suture was similar to silk. The foreign body in the bladder may have been the cause of infection. Artificial material used for an operation of an organ in the pelvic area sometimes slips into the bladder and causes inflammation.

In the 6 patients (0.58%) who required urological surgical treatment for viral HC, we retrospectively analyzed patient characteristics and outcomes. Two patients underwent nephrostomy for bilateral hydronephrosis due to bladder tamponade. One of these patients showed no improvement in renal function, graft versus host disease worsened and he died on postoperative day (POD) 5. The other patient displayed improved renal function but hematuria did not improve, and total cystectomy was required. To control bleeding, we performed transurethral electrocoagulation (TUC) on 3 patients, and total cystectomy was performed on 2 patients. All 3 patients who underwent TUC had BK virus HC. Two of these patients experienced marked improvement in hematuria from immediately after surgery. Hemostasis was only temporary in the other patient, who eventually died due to septicemia on POD 24. The 2 patients who underwent total cystectomy had adenovirus HC. Both experienced secondary hemorrhage postoperatively and required further surgery. Eventually, one died due to postoperative bleeding on POD 1, and one died due to postoperative pneumonia on POD 57. Urological surgical treatment for HC was effective in some cases, but the ultimate outcome greatly depends on the general condition of the patient and treatment of the underlying hematological disorder.

A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with bilateral multiple renal tumors (T1aN0M1, PUL, OSS) with two lesions in the right kidney and a solitary lesion of the left kidney in 2008. He underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for the right side in September 2008. The next month, ex vivo partial nephrectomy and auto-transplantation was performed for the left kidney because the tumor was located very close to the collecting system. Metastatectomies for the lung and bone followed and the histopathological findings of all lesions were clear cell carcinoma. The following years went well without any recurrence. Seven years after the surgery, the patient complained of asymptomatic gross hematuria and cystoscopy revealed a solitary non-papillary tumor of the bladder. Transurethral resection of the tumor was performed in June 2015 and the histopathological diagnosis of the resected specimens was clear cell carcinoma. Because the additional immunohistochemical examinations were positive for CD10 and negative for CK7, we diagnosed the bladder tumor as metastasis arising from RCC. Direct dissemination of the tumor cells into the urinary tract during partial nephrectomy followed by implantation to the bladder mucosa is a probable mechanism of metastasis in this case. </AbstractText>

Applicable to several domains, health included, the nudging approach runs in connection with requests and needs arising from marketing strategies, with the aim of maximizing economic rationality and efficiency. However, as nudge was framed having in mind the notion of consumer, it fails to fully meet the values connected to the idea of citizenship. Most nudges strategies seem to imply a top-down vision - though soft paternalistic - where pre-defined and often black-boxed values pretend to define individual and collective directions. The representational and ethical issues surrounding nudge, the psychological mechanisms working behind it, and the correlated legal issues request a precise and accurate scrutiny, if we want nudging interventions to be legitimately and democratically framed within policy strategies and human agency not to be disregarded, but empowered by behaviourally-based actions. </AbstractText>

As the epidemic began in Brazil, an increase of microcephaly cases was registered, causing concern and inducing the World Health Organization to raise an alarm. Certainly, the Zika virus, as many other viruses, has the capacity to induce severe cerebral lesions in foetuses of women infected during the first months of pregnancy. Moreover, more than 80% of cases of craniostenosys that verisimilarly took place in Brazil from September 2015 up to now were registered in few states of North- Eastern Brazil, where peaks of this malformation were registered several years before the appearance of Zika virus. In addition, in none of the 60 Countries where Zika virus is epidemiologically active an increase of the incidence of microcephaly has been reported. This paper intends to analyse some doubts concerning the link between Zika virus and the epidemic of craniostenosys. </AbstractText>

Exposure to asbestos has been linked with cancer at several levels of the gastrointestinal tract, and it has been documented, in an animal model, a direct cytotoxic effect of asbestos fibres on the ileum. It has been recently described a possible link between asbestos and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and asbestos fibres have been detected in humans in histological samples from colon cancer and in gallbladder bile. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of an enterohepatic translocation of asbestos fibres, alternative to lymphatic translocation from lungs. In animal models, asbestos fibres ingested with drinking water act as a co-carcinogen in the presence of benzo(a) pyrene and, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC ), there is evidence pointing to a causal effect of ingested asbestos on gastric and colorectal cancer. The risk seems to be proportional to the concentration of ingested fibres, to the extent of individual water consumption, to exposure timing, and to the possible exposure to other toxics (i.e., benzo(a)pyrene). Furthermore, the exposure to asbestos by ingestion could explain the epidemiological finding of mesothelioma in subjects certainly unexposed by inhalation. In conclusion, several findings suggest that health risks from asbestos could not exclusively derive from inhalation of fibres. Health hazards might also be present after ingestion, mainly after daily ingestion of drinking water for long periods. In Italy, a systemic assessment of the presence of asbestos fibres in drinking water is still lacking, although asbestos-coated pipelines are widely diffused and still operating. Despite the fact that the existence of a threshold level for health risks linked to the presence of asbestos in drinking water is still under debate, the precautionary principle should impose all possible efforts in order to revise health policies concerning this topic, and a systematic monitoring of drinking water to quantify the presence of asbestos is certainly needed in all regions. Further epidemiological studies aimed to the identification of exposed communities and to an adequate health risk assessment in their specific geographical areas are urgently needed. </AbstractText>

The KR12:Hp-?Cd composition was evaluated for particle size and its zeta (?)-potential in the presence and absence of cells. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis for the peptide alone or associated was evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration. The cytotoxicity of the peptide and composition toward fibroblasts, Caco-2 cells, and A431 cells was determined using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; thiazolyl blue assay and hemolysis assay. Membrane integrity was analyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase assay. KR12:Hp-?Cd decreased the peptide concentration required for the antimicrobial effect. Moreover, this composition was able to modify cell surface parameters, such as ?-potential, and alter the degree of hemolysis induced by KR12. However, the KR12:Hp-?Cd and KR12 alone alter the zeta potential of cells to a similar extent, suggesting a similar level of membrane interaction. The peptide alone inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 and A431 cells more efficiently than KR12:Hp-?Cd (p?<?0.001), but did not show significant cytotoxic effects via the dehydrogenase lactate assay. Both substances were effective in inhibiting the growth of odontopathogenic bacteria, as well as inhibiting Caco-2 epithelial cells.

The soil water was recovered by using vacuum/heat distillation. The experiments were held under different conditions to control rates of water evaporation and water recovery. Recoveries, ?(18)O and ?(2)H values of the soil water were determined. Analyses of the data using a Rayleigh distillation model indicate that under the experimental conditions only loosely bound water is extractable in cases where the recovery is smaller than 100?%. Due to isotopic exchange between vapour and remaining water in the micro channels or capillaries of the soil matrix, isotopic fractionation may take place under near-equilibrium conditions. This causes the observed relationship between ?(2)H and ?(18)O of the extracted water samples to have a slope close to 8. The results of this study may indicate that, in arid zones when soil that initially contains water dries out, the slope of the relationship between ?(2)H and ?(18)O values should be close to 8. Thus, a smaller slope, as observed by some groundwater and soil water samples in arid zones, may be caused by evaporation of water before the water has entered the unsaturated zone. </AbstractText>

These indicators highlight processes concerning sustainability of water resources in the aquifer (e.g. surface/groundwater interaction, recharge processes, and marine intrusion). The spatial variation of stable and radioactive isotopic contents indicates a mixing of modern and old water within the system. Recent recharge was observed mainly along the Souss River (the major surface-water drainage in the study area) and in the irrigated areas. Mapping of chemical and isotopic variation shows that the area is affected by abstraction, irrigation water return, and the evolution of modern recharge in time and space. The processes, distribution, and timing of groundwater flow are influenced by short- and long-term effects; long-term recharge is dependent on climatic conditions. This study can be used to make informed decisions about water-resource allocation and alternative management practices. </AbstractText>

The amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were higher in PM2.5 than in CPM. Conversely, microbial elements LPS and ?-glucan were much higher in CPM than in PM2.5. Concentrations of Si, Al, Fe, and Ti in CPM were greater than in PM2.5, while Pb, Cu and As concentrations were lower than in PM2.5. When RAW264.7 cells were treated with PM2.5 and CPM, the pro-inflammatory response in the cells was associated with the microbial element levels and attenuated partly by both polymyxin B (PMB) and N-acetylcystein (NAC). The expression of the oxidative stress response gene heme oxygenase1 was associated with PAHs levels. The exacerbating effects of the two-types of PM on murine lung eosinophilia were compared to clarify the role of toxic materials. When BALB/c mice were intratracheally instilled with PM2.5 or CPM (total 0.4?mg)?+?ovalbumin (OVA), both exacerbated lung eosinophilia along with allergy-relevant biological indicators, such as OVA-specific IgE in serum; enhancement of lung pathology when compared with counterpart samples without OVA. The exacerbating effects were greater in microbial element-rich CPM than in organic chemical-rich PM2.5. These results indicate that microbial elements have more potently exacerbating effects on the development of lung eosinophilia than do organic chemicals. In addition, oxidative stress and transition metals might be associated with the exacerbation of this negative effect. </AbstractText>

Wide ranges of variation were found in analyzed cultivars for the contents of water-soluble phenolics (121.6-223.7?mg/g dry weight (DW)), total catechins (TC) (90.5-177.2?mg/g DW), antioxidant activities (PSC values 627.3-2332.3??mol of vitamin C equiv/g DW, ORAC values (1865.1-3489.3??mol of vitamin C equiv/g DW), CAA values (37.7-134.3??mol of QE/g DW without PBS wash and 25.3-75.4??mol of QE/g DW with PBS wash) and antiproliferative activity (53.0-90.8% at the concentration of 400??g/mL extracts). The PSC, ORAC and CAA values were significantly correlated with phenolics, epicatechin gallate (ECG), CC and TC. Knowledge of specific differences among tea cultivars is important for breeding tea cultivars and gives sights to its potential application to promote health. </AbstractText>

27919168|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">There is accumulating evidence suggesting that Mediterranean lifestyles, including nutrition and sleeping patterns as well as social integration, may play a role in reducing age-related diseases. However, the literature is mostly deficient of evidence provided by Italian Mediterranean islands that more closely adhered to the originally described lifestyles. In this paper, we described the rationale and the study design of the Mediterranean healthy Eating, Ageing, and Lifestyle (MEAL) study, a prospective population-based cohort established in Sicily, southern Italy. The main exposures investigated are classical determinants of health, including demographic, nutritional habits, smoking and physical activity status, as well as eating-related behaviors, sleeping habits, sun exposure, social resources, and perceived stress. Anthropometric measurements will be collected. The main outcomes included depression, quality of life, and, after the follow-up period, also cardiovascular disease and cancer. The MEAL study may provide important data to increase our knowledge regarding the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of age-related disorders in the Mediterranean region. </AbstractText>

However, the reported energy expenditure from these devices should be interpreted with caution, given their potential bias and error. Practical implications Although devices report the same outcome of EE estimation, they are not equivalent to each other and differ from criterion measurements during walking and running. These devices are not suitable as research measurement tools for recording precise and accurate EE estimates but may be suitable for use in interventions of behaviour change as they provide feedback to user on trends in energy expenditure. If intending to use these devices in studies where precise measurements of energy expenditure are required, researchers need to undertake specific validation and reliability studies prior to interventions and the collection of cross-sectional data. </AbstractText>

These complexes were determined by immunoblotting in plasma samples from healthy adults and patients with DM type 2. The influence of glyco-oxidation in vitro on the complexes was also investigated. Amounts of IGFBP-1/fibrinogen complexes in plasma from patients with DM2 were slightly but not significantly lower than in healthy persons. Such complexes in patients' samples participated in fibrin clot formation to a significantly decreased extent. In vitro experiments with glucose or methylglyoxal as reactive agents demonstrated that the complexes underwent glyco-oxidative modification leading to reduced formation and/or stability. Extensively oxidized fibrinogen almost completely lost its ability to bind IGFBP-1. The reduced affinity of fibrinogen for IGFBP-1 accompanying diabetes may potentially shift the equilibrium to liberate more IGFBP-1 (and possibly IGF-I) able to activate platelets during coagulation, so contributing to the hypercoagulation state together with other factors. This hypothesis, however, needs further examination. </AbstractText>

Accidental camping-related CO poisoning occurred most frequently in May, late spring in Korea. Gas stove use and the burning of charcoal for tent heating were responsible for camping-related CO exposure. Seventeen victims (39.5%) were found dead when an ambulance arrived at the scene, in the cases reported in the media. In contrast, all the victims at our hospital were alive on hospital discharge.

A pressure drop across a pneumotachograph is measured within a sealed chamber during inspiration/exhalation of the nonhuman primate, generating respiratory values and breathing frequencies. Due to the fluctuation of depth of anesthesia, pre-exposure respiratory values can be variable, leading to less precise and accurate dosing calculations downstream. Although an anesthesia infusion pump may help stabilize the depth of sedation, pumps are difficult to use within a sealed head-out plethysmography chamber. Real-time, head-out plethysmography acquisition could increase precision and accuracy of the measurements, but the bulky equipment needed for head-out plethysmography precludes real-time use inside a Class III biological safety cabinet, where most aerosol exposures occur. However, the respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) acquisition method measures the same respiratory parameters by detecting movement of the chest and abdomen during breathing using two elastic bands within the Class III biological safety cabinet. As respiratory values are relayed to a computer for software integration and analysis real-time, adjustment of aerosol exposure duration is based on the depth of sedation of the animal. The objective of this study was to compare values obtained using two methodologies (pre-exposure head-out plethysmography and real-time RIP). Transitioning to RIP technology with real-time acquisition provides more consistent, precise, and accurate aerosol dosing by reducing reported errors in respiratory values from anesthesia variability when using pre-exposure head-out plethysmography acquisition. </AbstractText>

We, therefore, investigated the role of FL cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on tumor cell viability, in particular in response to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Stromal cells outgrown from FL patients were characterized and pure CAF populations were co-cultivated with FL cells. To analyze fibroblast-mediated effects, cells in co-culture were treated with ABT-737 and Bortezomib. The adherent cell population was positive for all fibroblastic markers tested and showed increased mRNA-expression of the activation marker FAP. No effect on FL cell viability was noted when co-cultivating them with CAFs. However, stromal cells protected tumor cells from apoptosis in response to cytotoxic treatment. This might be explained by mRNA-induction of ABCC1 and ABCG2 and up-regulation of BCL2L1 in FL cells. Our finding of protective mechanisms mediated by CAFs is of pivotal impact for further studies of cytotoxic agents in FL. </AbstractText>

Twenty-four carcases were examined postmortem. Histological lesions of pulmonary, hepatic and splenic erythrophagocytosis and haemosiderosis were found in 23 of 24 birds. Fifteen birds also had haemoglobin-like protein droplets within renal tubular epithelial cells. Despite consistent histological lesions, a cause of death could not be established. Virology, bacteriology and molecular tests for avian influenza, avian paramyxovirus-1, avipoxvirus, Chlamydia psittaci, Plasmodium spp, Babesia spp, Leucocytozoon spp, and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Tissue concentrations of a range of heavy metals (n = 4 birds) were consistent with low level exposure, while examination of proventricular contents and mucus failed to detect any marine biotoxins or Clostridium botulinum toxin. Hepatic concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (n = 5 birds) were similar to background concentrations of PAHs previously found in yellow-eyed penguins from the South Island of New Zealand, but there were significantly higher concentrations of 1-methylnapthelene and 2-methylnapthelene in the birds found dead in this mortality cluster. The biological significance of this finding is unclear. A temporal investigation of the epidemic did not indicate either a common source or propagative epidemic pattern. Although our investigation did not definitively implicate a toxic or infectious agent, the results identified possible causes, such as toxic marine organisms and mycoplasmosis that should be investigated further in the event of future mortality clusters. </AbstractText>

Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is often regarded as the primary indicator of ENM bioactivity and toxicity, it remains unclear whether ENM produce ROS or whether ROS is an outcome of ENM-induced cell injury. Phagolysosomal disruption and cathepsin B release also promote bioactivity through inflammasome activation. Therefore, specific particle parameters, i.e. preexposure dispersion status and particle surface area, of two ENM (NiO and CeO2) were used to evaluate the role of ROS generation and cathepsin B release during ENM-induced toxicity. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0, 20, 40, or 80??g of poorly or well-dispersed NiO-NP or CeO2-NP in four types of dispersion media. At 1- and 7-day postexposure, lung lavage fluid was collected to assess inflammation, cytotoxicity, and inflammasome activation. Results showed that preexposure dispersion status correlated with postexposure pulmonary bioactivity. The differences in bioactivity of NiO-NP and CeO2-NP are likely due to NiO-NP facilitating the release of cathepsin B and in turn inflammasome activation generating proinflammatory cytokines. Further, both metal oxides acted as free radical scavengers. Depending on the pH, CeO2-NP acted as a free radical scavenger in an acidic environment (an environment mimicking the lysosome) while the NiO-NP acted as a scavenger in a physiological pH (an environment that mimics the cytosol of the cell). Therefore, results from this study suggest that ENM-induced ROS is not likely a mechanism of inflammasome activation. </AbstractText>

27919189|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease associated with weakening of bones and joint pain. It primarily involves autoimmunity, matrix destruction, osteoclastogenesis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Numerous cellular and humoral components of the immune system are involved in the etiology of diseases, however, the cardinal part is played by the inter-cellular signaling messengers called cytokines. Interleukins is a vaguely defined sub-class of cytokines that are abundantly found in the RA patients. The multifariousness and diversity in the function of the interleukins make them very likely to be associated with the pathogenesis in multiple ways. Nonetheless, the variety in opinions of researchers globally has led to contentious inferences. Ergo, in this review we have amalgamated the views of researchers from the past two decades till date to provide a comprehensive report about the role of interleukins in rheumatoid arthritis. </AbstractText>

Test group was pretreated with glycyrrhizin at a dose of 100?mg/kg/day for 10 days, and then the two groups were orally administered with celastrol at a dose of 1?mg/kg. The concentration of celastrol was determined using a sensitive and reliable LC-MS method. 3.?The results showed that glycyrrhizin could significantly decrease the plasma concentration (from 64.36?ng/mL to 38.42?ng/mL) and AUC0-t (from 705.39 to 403.43??g·h/L) of celastrol in rats. To investigate its potential mechanism, the effects of glycyrrhizin on the transport and metabolic stability of celastrol were investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayer transwell model and rat liver microsome incubation systems. The Caco-2 cell monolayer transwell experiments indicated that glycyrrhizin could increase the efflux ratio of celastrol (4.02 versus 6.51). However, the rat liver microsome incubation experiments showed that glycyrrhizin could significantly increase the intrinsic clearance rate of celastrol from 20.3?±?3.37 to 38.8?±?4.18??L/min/mg protein. 4.?In conclusion, these results indicated that the herb-drug interaction between glycyrrhizin and celastrol might occur when they were coadministered. </AbstractText>

Moreover, interest in PAHs has been mainly due to their carcinogenic property, these compounds are genotoxic, teratogenic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Polymorphism in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) have the capacity to convert procarcinogens into carcinogens, which is an imperative factor contributing to individual susceptibility to cancer development. The carcinogenicity potential of PAHs is related to their ability to bind to DNA, thereby enhances DNA cross-linking, causing a series of disruptive effects which can result in tumor initiation. They induce cellular toxicity by regulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which arbitrate apoptosis. Additionally, cellular toxicity-mediated apoptotic and autophagic cell death and immune suppression by industrial pollutants PAH, provide fertile ground for the proliferation of mutated cells, which results in cancer growth and progression. PAHs plays a foremost role in angiogenesis necessary for tumor metastasization by promoting the upregulation of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in human cancer cells. The present review sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of PAHs induced cancer development as well as autophagic and apoptotic cell death. Besides that authors have unraveled how phytotherapeutics is an alternate potential therapeutics acting as a savior from the toxic effects of PAHs for safer and cost effective perspectives. </AbstractText>

Renal involvement usually presents with crescentric glomerulonephritis, resulting in significant and permanent loss of renal functions and end-stage kidney disease. Higher NLR at baseline is associated with worse renal outcome. Our findings suggest that baseline NLR could have a predictive value for renal prognosis. We have also demonstrated a significant correlation between NLR and BVAS activity scores. Our data suggest that GPA patients with a significantly high NLR at baseline might need closer follow-up for persistent disease activity. </AbstractText>

Despite the frequency of this disease, there is currently no international consensus on its therapeutic modalities. The aim of this study was to conduct a review of the international literature on the treatment of GCA, whatever the clinical pattern. Oral corticosteroids remain the cornerstone treatment, possibly preceded by intravenous bolus in complicated forms. In cases of glucocorticoid dependence or glucocorticoid-related side effects, a glucocorticoid-sparing agent may be necessary. Methotrexate is one of the most used treatments despite its low level of evidence and mild efficacy. Cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab look promising but require validation in further studies. The results for TNF-? blockers and azathioprine are disappointing. Preventing complications of prolonged corticosteroid therapy is a world challenge and the management of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis is not the same from one country to another. There is a significant risk of arterial thrombosis, mainly at treatment onset, which may encourage to associate an antiplatelet therapy, especially in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Place of statins in the treatment of the disease is uncertain. </AbstractText>

Apart from the conventional anti-neoplastic agents, metformin, a biguanide anti-diabetic agent, has recently found to have anti-cancer property. Several studies observed the effect of metformin towards its anti-cancer effect on colon or colorectal cancer in diabetic patients. However, only a few studies showed its effect on colorectal cancer in relation to the non-diabetic status. The present review aimed to highlight the insight into the molecular pathway of metformin towards colorectal cancer in the absence of diabetes mellitus. In CRC-independent of diabetes mellitus, highly deregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway is found which activates the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Metformin inhibits cancer growth in colon by suppressing the colonic epithelial proliferation by inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Metformin exerts its anti-neoplastic effects by acting on tumour suppressor pathway via activating the adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Metformin interrupts the glucose metabolism by activating the AMPK. Metformin reduces tumour cell growth and metastasis by activating the p53 tumour suppressor gene. In addition to its therapeutic benefits, metformin is easily accessible, cost effective with better tolerance to the patients compared to the chemotherapeutic agents. This review summarised modern findings on the therapeutic applications of metformin on the colorectal cancer with no evidences of diabetes mellitus. </AbstractText>

The first set consisted of nine compounds which included Magnolol, Honokiol and other GABA acting established compounds. The second set consisted of 16 derivatives of N-diarylalkenyl-piperidinecarboxylic acid. The third QSAR dataset was made up of thirty two compounds which were Magnolol and Honokiol derivatives. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM) supervised quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed to predict the biological activity of these three sets. The purpose of taking three QSAR sets of diverse chemical structures but identical in their GABA targeting and pharmacological action was to identify common chemical structure features responsible for structure-activity relationship (SAR). Linear and non-linear QSAR models confirmed that the three sets shared common structural descriptors derived from WHIM (Weighted Holistic Invariant Molecular descriptors), 3D-MoRSE and Eigenvalue classes. In the study,it was concluded that properties like electro negativity and polarizability play a crucial role in controlling the activity of herbal compounds against GABA receptor. </AbstractText>

Researchers working with hydrogels can consider these findings which have the potential to allow for commercialization within the suitable (chemical, herbal or pharmaceutical industries). Additionally, this article reviewed the details of various existing patents of biological preparations involving hydrogels and sterilization processes. The authors concluded that each case requires individual consideration where it must be submitted to a specific sterilization method that may involve more than one technique to obtain an aseptic material to assay by avoiding physicochemical and biological alterations.

Poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) are able to deliver drugs and gene efficiently. This formulation has several advantages in comparison with other formulations including improvement of solubility, stability, controlling of degradation and release of the entrapped agents. For application of PLGA as gene carrier, there exist many challenges. PLGA nanoparticles could protect the encapsulated DNA from in vivo degradation but the DNA release is slowl and their negative charge acts as a barrier to DNA incorporation and delivery. Also, during the preparation process, DNA could be exposed to high shear stress and organic solvents which could result in its inactivation. Moreover, PLGA NPs could be modified with different agents to reduce its cytotoxicity, to enhance the delivery efficiency and to target it to specific tissues/cells. This review summarizes different methods used for the preparation of PLGA NPs as gene carriers and recent strategies for modification of PLGA particles applied in gene therapy. </AbstractText>

Agents that target this enzyme have been in clinical use in cancer therapy for over 30 years with great success. The types of compounds that have been developed to target TopoII are broadly divided into poisons and catalytic inhibitors. The TopoII poisons are in clinical use as anti-cancer therapies, although in common to most chemotherapeutic agents, they display considerable normal tissue toxicity. Inhibition of the TopoIIb isoform has been implicated in this cytotoxicity. Response to TopoII active agents is determined by several factors, but cell cycle checkpoints play a large role in sensitivity and resistance. The G2/M phase checkpoints are of particular importance in considering the effectiveness of these drugs and are reviewed in this article. Functionality of the ATM dependent decatenation checkpoint may represent a new avenue for selective cancer therapy. Here we review the function of TopoII, the anti-cancer mechanisms and limitations of current catalytic inhibitors and poisons, and their influence on cell cycle checkpoints. We will also assess potential new mechanisms for targeting this enzyme to limit normal tissue toxicity, and how the cell cycle checkpoint triggered by these drugs may provide an alternative and possibly better target for novel therapies. </AbstractText>

Recent studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with tooth loss or soft diet in young animal model, and that BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, single or combined effect of tooth loss and/or soft diet on brain function has not fully understood.

This study investigated the frequency of rs895819 in pregnant normotensive and preeclamptic Black South African (SA) women. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Enrollment into the study included: normotensive (n?=?95; 45 HIV+; 80 analysed for rs895819T?>?C, age range: 16-46 years) and PE patients (n?=?98; 45 HIV+; 56 analysed for rs895819T?>?C), age range: 16-42 years). DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Genotyping of miRNA-27a rs895819 was detected using a TaqMan® SNP Genotyping assay. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We did not find a significant association of miR-27a polymorphism with PE susceptibility in our data. However, in the subgroup analysis (based in HIV status), the variant genotypes (TC/CC) were associated with higher body mass index (BMI) among PE women (32.57 vs. 29.25, p?=?0.064), significantly in the presence of HIV infection (33.47 vs. 27.8, p?=?0.005). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The results of this study suggests that miR-27a rs895819 may not be associated with PE susceptibility; however, the miR-27a TC/CC genotype increases susceptibility to elevated BMI in PE, which may be significantly influenced by co-morbid HIV infection among pregnant women on HAART. </AbstractText>

The current methodological, ethical and pedagogical challenges in measuring young people's sexual health behaviours are discussed along with the issues associated with the sexual health items introduced to the HBSC study in 2002. The development and piloting of new cross-national items for use in the 2013/14 HBSC data collection are presented and discussed. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">An international pilot study was undertaken to determine the impact of these proposed changes. Questionnaires and classroom discussion groups were conducted in five pilot countries in 2012/2013 (France, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal and Romania) with a total of 612 school-aged children (age M?=?15.55 years, SD?=?0.95). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The majority of participants in each country provided positive feedback about the appropriateness of the questions. Some small cross-national differences were found in the self-reported quantitative data relating to the appropriateness of the questions (?(2)?=?22.831, df?=?9, p?=?.007, V?=?.117). Qualitative feedback suggests that for the vast majority of students the phrasing and age-targeting of the questions were considered appropriate. With the exception of a small number of respondents who commented on the clarity and/or personal nature of the content, no specific issues with the questions were identified. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These findings provide guidance on the answerability (including the extent of missing and inconsistent data), understandability, acceptability (including in different cultures) and relevance of questions to potential participants. The findings from the pilot study suggest that in general, the questions are understandable, acceptable, and of a high priority to the target population, and that the simplification has significantly reduced the proportion of missing data. The new developments thus enhance the capacity of the questions to measure cross-nationally, sensitive aspects of young people's sexual behaviour. These questions were included in the 2013/2014 round of the HBSC survey and will continue to be used to monitor trends in adolescent sexual health and behaviours, and to inform and influence health services and health education policy and practice at local, national and international levels. </AbstractText>

There is a need, however, for increased therapist contact for some patient groups. Combining iCBT with traditional face-to-face (ftf) consultations in a blended format (B-CBT) may produce a new treatment format with multiple benefits from both traditional CBT and iCBT such as individual adaptation, lower costs than traditional therapy, wide geographical and temporal availability, and possibly lower threshold to implementation. The primary aim of the present study is to compare directly the clinical effectiveness of B-CBT with face-to-face CBT for adult major depressive disorder. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS/DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">The study is designed as a two arm randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing blended CBT for adult depression with treatment as usual (TAU). In the blended condition six sessions of ftf CBT is alternated with six to eight online modules (NoDep). TAU is defined as 12 sessions of ftf CBT. The primary outcome is symptomatic change of depressive symptoms on the patient-health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Additionally, the study will include an economic evaluation. All participants must be 18 years of age or older and meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders 4th edition. Participants are randomised on an individual level by a researcher not involved in the project. The primary outcome is analysed by regressing the three-month follow-up PHQ-9 data on the baseline PHQ-9 score and a treatment group indicator using ancova. A sample size of 130 in two balanced groups will yield a power of at least 80% to detect standardised mean differences above 0.5 on a normally distributed variable. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This study design will compare B-CBT and ftf CBT in a concise and direct manner with only a minimal of the variance explained by differences in therapeutic content. On the other hand, while situated in routine care, ecological validity is somewhat compromised by the controlled manner in which the study is conducted. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="TRIAL REGISTRATION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02796573 .

As more efficacious vaccines will be available in the near future, it is essential to understand the geographically diverse patterns of typhoid risk levels and to prioritize the right populations for vaccination to effectively control the disease. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A composite index called the typhoid risk factor (TRF) index was created based on data with the Global Positioning System (GPS). Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and National Geographical Data Center (NGDC) satellite lights data were used for this analysis. A count model was adopted to validate the TRF index against the existing surveillance burden data. The TRF index was then re-estimated for 66 countries using the most recent data and mapped out for two geographical levels (sub-national boundary and grid-cell levels). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The TRF index which consists of drinking water sources, toilet facility types, and population density appeared to be statistically significant to explain variation in the disease burden data. The mapping analysis showed that typhoid risk levels vary not only by country but also by sub-national region. The grid-cell level analysis highlighted that the distribution of typhoid risk factors is uneven within the sub-national boundary level. Typhoid risk levels are geographically heterogeneous. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Given the insufficient number of surveillance studies, the TRF index serves as a useful tool by capturing multiple risk factors of the disease into a single indicator. This will help decision makers identify high risk areas for typhoid as well as other waterborne diseases. Further, the study outcome can guide researchers to find relevant places for future surveillance studies. </AbstractText>

Additional analyses were conducted to examine factors that explain the health inequalities (e.g. age, gender, education and residence). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among households reporting utilization of health services, public health facilities were used more often for inpatient care, while they were used less for outpatient care. Overall, the utilization of inpatient and outpatient care, and antenatal care was equally distributed among income groups, with CIs of 0.04, 0.03 and 0.08, respectively. However, the poor used more public facilities while the wealthy used more private facilities. There was a substantial inequality in the use of institutional delivery services, with a CI of 0.31. Poorer women had a lower rate of institutional deliveries overall, in both public and private facilities, compared to the wealthy. Location was an important factor in explaining the inequality in the use of health services. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The large gap between the rich and poor in access to and utilization of key maternal services, such as institutional delivery, may be a central factor to the high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity and impedes efforts to make progress toward universal health coverage. While poorer households use public health services more often, the use of public facilities for outpatient visits remains half that of private facilities. Pro-poor targeting as well as a better understanding of the private sector's role in increasing equitable coverage of maternal health services is needed. Equity-oriented approaches in health should be prioritized to promote more inclusive health system reforms. </AbstractText>

Our analyses were guided by the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM), a theoretical health behavior model that classifies parents in one of six stages: unaware, unengaged, undecided, decided not to vaccinate, decided to vaccinate and those who had already vaccinated their sons. Rigorous methods were used to filter out careless responders: response variance, bogus items, psychometric antonyms and psychometric synonyms. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">At T1 and T2, we received 3,784 and 1,608 respectively completed questionnaires; after data cleaning 3,117 (T1) and 1,427 (T2) were retained.

At both T1 and T2, most parents (over 70%) belonged to the earlier vaccination adoption stages: 57% were unaware (T1) and 15.3% (T2); 20.9% were unengaged (T1) and 32.4% (T2); and 9.1% were undecided (T1) and 25.2% (T2). At follow-up, 37.7% of participants did not move from their initial PAPM decision-making stage.

Focus groups were carried out in each hospital with a theoretical convenience sample of 10-15 HCPs. Categorical analysis was conducted. Emerging categories and additional topics derived by literature search were used to develop the survey questionnaire, which included 13 questions expressed through a 4-point Likert scale. Members of surgical teams were invited by e-mail to fill in the questionnaire. We summed up the points assigned to each 4-point Likert scale response and calculated a cumulative score expressing overall concordance to expected HCPs attitudes on SAP.

Due to the similarity among monomers, their organizational pattern and abundance, satDNAs are hardly accessible to structural and functional studies and still represent the most obscure genome component. Although many satDNA arrays of diverse length and even single monomers exist in the genome, surprisingly little is known about transition from satDNAs to other sequences. Studying satDNA monomers at junctions and identifying DNA sequences adjacent to them can help to understand the processes that (re)distribute satDNAs and significance that evolution of these sequence elements might have in creating the genomic landscape. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We explored sets of randomly selected satDNA-harboring genomic fragments in four mollusc species to examine satDNA transition sites, and the nature of adjacent sequences. All examined junctions are characterized by abrupt transitions from satDNAs to other sequences. Among them, junctions of only one examined satDNA mapped non-randomly (within the palindrome), indicating that well-defined sequence feature is not a necessary prerequisite in the junction formation. In the studied sample, satDNA flanking sequences can be roughly classified into two groups. The first group is composed of anonymous DNA sequences which occasionally include short segments of transposable elements (TEs) as well as segments of other satDNA sequences. In the second group, satDNA repeats and the array flanking sequences are identified as parts of TEs of the Helitron superfamily. There, some array flanking regions hold fragmented satDNA monomers alternating with anonymous sequences of comparable length as missing monomer parts, suggesting a process of sequence reorganization by a mechanism able to excise short monomer parts and replace them with unrelated sequences. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The observed architecture of satDNA transition sites can be explained as a result of insertion and/or recombination events involving short arrays of satDNA monomers and TEs, in combination with hypothetical transposition-related ability of satDNA monomers to be shuffled independently in the genome. We conclude that satDNAs and TEs can form a complex network of sequences which essentially share the propagation mechanisms and in synergy shape the genome. </AbstractText>

Recently research has begun to focus on the role the microbiome plays in asthma pathogenesis in the hope of further understanding this respiratory disorder. Considered sterile until recently, the lungs have revealed themselves to contain a unique microbiota. A shift towards molecular methods for the quantification and sequencing of microbial DNA has revealed that the airways harbour a unique microbiota with apparent, reproducible differences present between healthy and diseased lungs. There is a hope that in classifying the microbial load of the asthmatic airway an insight may be afforded as to the possible role pulmonary microbes may have in propagating an asthmatic airway response. This could potentially pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic lung conditions such as asthma. </AbstractText>

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as one of the most important pulmonary pathogens and the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. A multifarious interplay between the host, pathogens, microbiota, and the environment shapes the course of the disease. There have been several excellent reviews detailing CF pathology, Pseudomonas and the role of environment in CF but only a few reviews connect these entities with regards to influence on the overall course of the disease. A holistic understanding of contributing factors is pertinent to inform new research and therapeutics. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this article, we discuss the deterministic alterations in lung physiology as a result of CF.

Within a decade of the removal of drug pressure, the molecular marker of chloroquine-resistant malaria had disappeared and the drug was shown to have excellent clinical efficacy. Many countries have observed decreases in the prevalence of chloroquine resistance with the discontinuation of chloroquine use. In Zambia, chloroquine was used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria until treatment failures led the Ministry of Health to replace it with artemether-lumefantrine in 2003.

When asked about research priorities for future funding, respondents ranked tackling emerging drug and insecticide resistance the highest. With respect to research impact, the panel valued research that focuses on health and health sector benefits and informing policy and product development.

Two identical twin Tyrolean Grey calves exhibited weight loss, skeletal abnormalities and delayed development associated with kidney abnormalities and formation of uroliths. These signs resembled inherited renal tubular dysplasia found in Japanese Black cattle which is associated with mutations in the claudin 16 gene. Despite demonstrating striking phenotypic similarities, no obvious presence of pathogenic variants of this candidate gene were found. Therefore further analysis was required to decipher the genetic etiology of the condition. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The family history of the cases suggested the possibility of an autosomal recessive inheritance. Homozygosity mapping combined with sequencing of the whole genome of one case detected two associated non-synonymous private coding variants: A homozygous missense variant in the uncharacterized KIAA2026 gene (g.39038055C?>?G; c.926C?>?G), located in a 15 Mb sized region of homozygosity on BTA 8; and a homozygous 1 bp deletion in the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene (g.21222030delC; c.1881delG and c.1782delG), located in an 11 Mb region of homozygosity on BTA 24. Pathogenic variants in MOCOS have previously been associated with inherited metabolic syndromes and xanthinuria in different species including Japanese Black cattle. Genotyping of two additional clinically suspicious cases confirmed the association with the MOCOS variant, as both animals had a homozygous mutant genotype and did not show the variant KIAA2026 allele. The identified genomic deletion is predicted to be highly disruptive, creating a frameshift and premature termination of translation, resulting in severely truncated MOCOS proteins that lack two functionally essential domains. The variant MOCOS allele was absent from cattle of other breeds and approximately 4% carriers were detected among more than 1200 genotyped Tyrolean Grey cattle. Biochemical urolith analysis of one case revealed the presence of approximately 95% xanthine. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The identified MOCOS loss of function variant is highly likely to cause the renal syndrome in the affected animals.

ND is prevented by rigorous biocontainment and vaccination. One potential approach to prevent spread of the virus is production of birds that show innate resistance to NDV-caused disease. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows adult cells to be reprogrammed into an embryonic stem cell-like state capable of contributing to live offspring and passing on unique traits in a number of species. Recently, iPSC approaches have been successfully applied to avian cells. If chicken induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs) are genetically or epigenetically modified to resist NDV infection, it may be possible to generate ND resistant poultry. There is limited information on the potential of ciPSCs to be infected by NDV, or the capacity of these cells to become resistant to infection. The aim of the present work was to assess the characteristics of the interaction between NDV and ciPSCs, and to develop a selection method that would increase tolerance of these cells to NDV-induced cellular damage. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Results showed that ciPSCs were permissive to infection with NDV, and susceptible to virus-mediated cell death. Since ciPSCs that survived infection demonstrated the ability to recover quickly, we devised a system to select surviving cells through multiple infection rounds with NDV. ciPSCs that sustained 9 consecutive infections had a statistically significant increase in survival (up to 36 times) compared to never-infected ciPSCs upon NDV infection (tolerant cells). Increased survival was not caused by a loss of permissiveness to NDV replication. RNA sequencing followed by enrichment pathway analysis showed that numerous metabolic pathways where differentially regulated between tolerant and never-infected ciPSCs. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Results demonstrate that ciPSCs are permissive to NDV infection and become increasingly tolerant to NDV under selective pressure, indicating that this system could be applied to study mechanisms of cellular tolerance to NDV. </AbstractText>

The anticancer efficacy of rapamycin in combination with sodium bicarbonate to increase the intratumoral pH was tested in two different mouse models and compared to rapamycin treatment alone. Histological analysis was performed on tumor samples to evaluate proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Exposing cancer cells to acidic pH in vitro significantly reduced the anti-proliferative effect of rapamycin. At the molecular level, acidity significantly decreased mTORC1 activity, suggesting that cancer cell proliferation is independent of mTORC1 in acidic conditions. In contrast, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or AKT were not affected by acidity, and blocking MAPK or AKT with a chemical inhibitor maintained an anti-proliferative effect at low pH. In tumor mouse models, the use of sodium bicarbonate increased mTORC1 activity in cancer cells and potentiated the anti-cancer efficacy of rapamycin. Combining sodium bicarbonate with rapamycin resulted in increased tumor necrosis, increased cancer cell apoptosis and decreased cancer cell proliferation as compared to single treatment. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Taken together, these results emphasize the inefficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors in acidic conditions. They further highlight the potential of combining sodium bicarbonate with mTORC1 inhibitors to improve their anti-tumoral efficacy. </AbstractText>

We assessed the presence and severity of fatigue in patients with JIA, including factors presumed associated with fatigue (e.g., disease activity, disability, pain, physical activity, exercise capacity, and self-efficacy), and whether fatigue is related to participation in physical education classes, school attendance, and sports frequency. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The current study used baseline data of 80 patients with JIA (age 8-13) who participated in an intervention aimed at promoting physical activity. Primary outcome measurements were fatigue, assessed using the Pediatric-Quality-of-Life-Inventory (PedsQl)-Fatigue-scale and energy level assessed using a VAS scale. Other outcome measurements were disease activity (VAS Physician Global Assessment Scale), disability (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire), physical activity (accelerometer), exercise capacity (Bruce treadmill test), self-efficacy (Childhood Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale), and participation (self-report). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Sixty percent of patients with JIA suffered from daily low-energy levels; 27% suffered from very low-energy levels more than half the week. Low energy levels were best predicted by disability and low physical activity. Fatigue measured with the PEDsQL was higher compared to the control-population. Disability and low self-efficacy were main predictors of fatigue. Self-efficacy was a predictor of fatigue but did not act as moderator. Fatigue was a predictor for sports frequency but not for school attendance. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Fatigue is a significant problem for JIA patients.

27919266|a|<AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">In mammalian females, reproductive capacity is determined by the size of the primordial follicle pool. During embryogenesis, oogonia divide mitotically but cytokinesis is incomplete so oogonia remain connected in germ cell cysts. Oogonia begin to enter meiosis at 13.5 days postcoitum in the mouse and over several days, oocytes progress through the stages of meiotic prophase I arresting in the diplotene stage. Concurrently, germ cell cysts break apart and individual oocytes become surrounded by granulosa cells forming primordial follicles. In rats, inhibition of a synaptonemal complex protein caused premature arrival at the diplotene stage and premature primordial follicle assembly suggesting diplotene arrest might trigger primordial follicle formation. Cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation are blocked by exposure to steroid hormones but hormone effects on the timing of diplotene arrest are unclear. Here, we asked: (1) if oocytes were required to arrest in diplotene before follicles formed, (2) if all oocytes within a germ cell cyst arrested at diplotene synchronously, and (3) if steroid hormones affected progression through prophase I. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Meiotic stage and follicle formation were assessed in histological sections. Statistical differences over time were determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test. To determine if steroid hormones affect the rate of progression to the diplotene stage, 17.5 dpc ovaries were placed in organ culture with media containing estradiol, progesterone or both hormones. In this case, differences were determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We found primordial follicles containing oocytes at the diplotene stage as well as follicles containing oocytes at pre-diplotene stages. We also found individual germ cell cysts containing oocytes at both diplotene and pre-diplotene stages. Progesterone but not estradiol reduced the number of diplotene oocytes in ovary organ culture. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our results suggest that meiotic progression and primordial follicle formation are independent events. In addition, oocytes in germ cell cysts do not synchronously proceed through meiosis. Finally, only progesterone delayed transit though meiotic prophase I. </AbstractText>

Current treatment is based on a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Severe side effects are associated with chemotherapy due to use of high dosage and nonspecific uptake. Bisphosphonates have a strong affinity to Ca(2+) ions and are widely used in the treatment of bone disorders. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We have engineered a unique biodegradable bisphosphonate nanoparticle (NPs) bearing two functional surface groups: (1) primary amine groups for covalent attachment of a dye/drug (e.g. NIR dye Cy 7 or doxorubicin); (2) bisphosphonate groups for targeting and chelation to bone hydroxyapatite. In addition, these engineered NPs contain high polyethyleneglycol (PEG) concentration in order to increase their blood half life time. In vitro experiments on Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell line, demonstrated that at a tenth of the concentration, doxorubicin-conjugated bisphosphonate NPs achieved a similar uptake to free doxorubicin. In vivo targeting experiments using the NIR fluorescence bisphosphonate NPs on both Soas-2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model and orthotopic bone metastases mCherry-labeled 4T1 breast cancer mouse model confirmed specific targeting. In addition, therapeutic in vivo experiments using doxorubicin-conjugated bisphosphonate NPs demonstrated a 40% greater inhibition of tumor growth in Saos-2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model when compared to free doxorubicin. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this research we have shown the potential use of doxorubicin-conjugated BP NPs for the targeting and treatment of primary and metastatic bone tumors. The targeted delivery of doxorubicin to the tumor significantly increased the efficacy of the anti-cancer drug, thus enabling the effective use of a lower concentration of doxorubicin. Furthermore, the targeting ability of the BP NPs in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model reinforced our findings that these BP NPs have the potential to be used for the treatment of primary and metastatic bone cancer. </AbstractText>

Nevertheless, the field of nanotoxicology still suffers from a lack of relevant in vitro models and exposure methods to predict accurately the effects observed in vivo, especially after respiratory exposure. In this context, the aim of our study was to evaluate if exposing pulmonary cells at the air-liquid interface to aerosols of inhalable and poorly soluble nanomaterials generates different toxicity patterns and/or biological activation levels compared to classic submerged exposures to suspensions. Three nano-TiO2 and one nano-CeO2 were used. An exposure system was set up using VitroCell® devices to expose pulmonary cells at the air-liquid interface to aerosols. A549 alveolar cells in monocultures or in co-cultures with THP-1 macrophages were exposed to aerosols in inserts or to suspensions in inserts and in plates. Submerged exposures in inserts were performed, using similar culture conditions and exposure kinetics to the air-liquid interface, to provide accurate comparisons between the methods. Exposure in plates using classical culture and exposure conditions was performed to provide comparable results with classical submerged exposure studies. The biological activity of the cells (inflammation, cell viability, oxidative stress) was assessed at 24 h and comparisons of the nanomaterial toxicities between exposure methods were performed. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Deposited doses of nanomaterials achieved using our aerosol exposure system were sufficient to observe adverse effects. Co-cultures were more sensitive than monocultures and biological responses were usually observed at lower doses at the air-liquid interface than in submerged conditions. Nevertheless, the general ranking of the nanomaterials according to their toxicity was similar across the different exposure methods used. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">We showed that exposure of cells at the air-liquid interface represents a valid and sensitive method to assess the toxicity of several poorly soluble nanomaterials. We underlined the importance of the cellular model used and offer the possibility to deal with low deposition doses by using more sensitive and physiologic cellular models. This brings perspectives towards the use of relevant in vitro methods of exposure to assess nanomaterial toxicity. </AbstractText>

Altering diet characteristics so as to reduce voluntary food intake (VFI) can improve the likelihood of success, although this should not be at the expense of palatability. The aim of the current study was to compare the VFI and palatibility of novel commercially available canine and feline weight loss diets. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The relative performance of two canine (C1 and C2) and two feline (F1 and F2) diets was assessed in groups of healthy adult dogs and cats, respectively. Diets varied in energy, protein, fibre, and fat content. To assess canine VFI, 12 (study 1) and 10 (study 2) dogs were offered food in 4 meals, for 15 min on each occasion, with hourly intervals between the meals. For feline VFI, 12 cats were offered food ad libitum for a period of 18 h per day over 5 consecutive days. The palatability studies used separate panels of 37 dogs and 30 cats, with the two diets being served, side-by-side, in identical bowls. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In dogs, VFI was significantly less for diet C1 than diet C2 when assessed on energy intake (study 1, 42% less, P?=?0.032; study 2, 28% less, P?=?0.019), but there was no difference in gram weight intake (study 1: P?=?0.964; study 2: P?=?0.255). In cats, VFI was 17% less for diet F1 than diet F2 when assessed by energy intake (P?<?0.001), but there was again no difference in gram weight (P?=?0.207). There was no difference in palatability between the two canine diets (P?=?0.490), whilst the panel of cats diet preferred F1 to F2 (P?<?0.001). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Foods with different characteristics can decrease VFI without affecting palatability in both dogs and cats. The effects seen could be due to decreased energy content, decreased fat content, increased fibre content, different fibre source, and increased protein content. Further studies are now needed to determine whether similar findings occur in obese dogs and cats on controlled weight loss programmes. </AbstractText>

The patient initially presented with pathologically late awakening and was extubated 17 h after admission. Neurologic clinical status after extubation showed global aphasia, mental slowness and spatio-temporal disorientation. The injected cerebral CT scan was normal; the EEG was inconclusive (it showed metabolic encephalopathy without epileptic activity); and the cerebral MRI done 48 h after surgery showed multiple small subcortical acute ischemic lesions, mainly on the left fronto- parieto- temporo-occipital lobes. He was taken for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT) over 54 h after cardiac surgery. The first session ended abruptly after 20 min when the patient suffered a generalised tonico-clonic seizure, necessitating a moderately rapid decompression, airway management, and antiepileptic treatment. In total, the patient received 7 HOT sessions over 6 days. He demonstrated full neurological recovery at 4 weeks and GOS (Glasgow Outcome Scale) of 5 out of 5 even after a long delay in initial management. Convulsions are a rare complication of HOT either due to reperfusion syndrome or hyperoxic toxicity and can be managed. Prior imaging by MRI or tympanic paracentesis (myringotomy) should not add further delay of treatment. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">HOT should be initiated upon late awakening and/or neurologic symptoms after CPB heart surgery, after exclusion of formal counter-indications, even if the delay exceeds 48 h. </AbstractText>

Studies show that although cardiac pharmacologic support is applied when rewarming these patients, a lack of updated treatment recommendations exist. Mainly due to lack of clinical and experimental data, neither of the international guidelines includes information about pharmacologic cardiac support at temperatures below 30 °C. However, core temperature of accidental hypothermia patients is often reduced below 30 °C. Few human studies exploring effects of adrenergic drugs during hypothermia have been published, and therefore prevailing information is collected from pre-clinical studies. The most prominent finding in these studies is an apparent depressive effect of adrenaline on cardiac function when used in doses which elevate cardiac output during normothermia. Also noradrenaline and isoprenaline largely lacked positive cardiac effects during hypothermia, while dopamine is a more promising drug for supporting cardiac function during rewarming. Data and information from these studies are in support of the prevailing notion; not to use adrenergic drugs at core temperatures below 30 °C. </AbstractText>

Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34% of the respondents reporting more than 50% time savings. In addition, around 75% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers. </AbstractText>

Targeting populations that can most benefit from this therapy is now of major importance.Survival has steadily improved for a decade, reaching up to 65% at hospital discharge in the most recent cohorts. However, ECMO is still marred by frequent and significant complications such as bleeding and nosocomial infections. In addition, physiological and psychological symptoms are commonly described in long-term follow-up of ECMO-treated ARDS survivors. Because this therapy is costly and exposes patients to significant complications, seven prediction models have been developed recently to help clinicians identify patients most likely to survive once ECMO has been initiated and to facilitate appropriate comparison of risk-adjusted outcomes between centres and over time. Higher age, immunocompromised status, associated extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction, low respiratory compliance and non-influenzae diagnosis seem to be the main determinants of poorer outcome. </AbstractText>

Similar frequencies of leprosy reactions and other clinical manifestations were observed in paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB) leprosy patients treated with U-MDT and regular MDT (R-MDT) (P?=?0.43 and P?=?0.61, respectively). Compared with PB patients, leprosy reactions were significantly more frequent in MB patients with a high BI, and more patients developed RR than ENL. However, RR and neuritis were also reported in patients with a negative BI. At baseline, the highest rate of ML Flow positivity was observed in patients with a positive BI, especially those who developed ENL, followed by patients who had neuritis and RR.

However, in amphibians, the type and amount of hormone necessary to induce spermiation can be highly variable, even among closely related species. We are unaware of any studies that have examined the spermiation response to exogenous hormones across highly differentiated populations within a species. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We examined variation in sperm viability and production in response to the hormone LHRH among four divergent populations of the Red-eyed Treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas). We hypothesized that these highly differentiated populations would show variability in sperm count and viability in response to two dosages, 2 ?g/g and 4 ?g/g, of the hormone LHRH. We collected spermic urine 3 h post injection (PI). We then examined variation in spermiation at 3, 7, 12, and 24 h PI of LHRH for two allopatric populations that previously showed evidence of premating behavioral isolation. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">One population of Red-eyed Treefrog exhibited reduced sperm viability but not count in response to the hormone LHRH compared to all other populations. In addition, we found peak viability at 3 h PI for the allopatric population comparison. There was no difference in sperm production within or between populations at 3, 7, 12, or 24 h PI. For both studies, intrapopulation variation was high. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">ART often focuses on threatened species with small, isolated populations, which could evolve localized differences due to the evolutionary process of drift and selection. The high variation in response and the population-level differences in sperm viability we observed demonstrate that practitioners of ART should consider the possibility of divergent responses to hormones which may affect study design and animal receptivity to ART protocols. </AbstractText>

Although CCDC88A has been previously reported to be a binding partner and substrate of Akt, the level of active Akt was not associated with the translocation of CCDC88A towards cell protrusions. CCDC88A-dependent promotion of cell migration and invasiveness was not modulated by Akt signaling. Knockdown of CCDC88A decreased phosphorylated Src and ERK1/2 and increased phosphorylated AMPK1 in PDAC cells. Knockdown of AMPK1 inhibited the migration and invasiveness of PDAC cells. The combined data suggest that CCDC88A may be a useful marker for predicting the outcome of patients with PDAC and that CCDC88A can promote PDAC cell migration and invasion through a signaling pathway that involves phosphorylation of Src and ERK1/2 and/or dephosphorylation of AMPK1. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">CCDC88A was accumulated in cell protrusions, contributed to the formation of membrane protrusions, and increased the migration and invasiveness of PDAC cells. </AbstractText>

Although routine tail docking is banned within the EU, it remains a common practice to prevent tail biting. Straw as environmental enrichment has been proposed as an alternative to tail docking, but its effectiveness against tail biting and function in manure handling systems have to be considered. The aim of the study was to survey how pigs with intact tails are raised and how tail biting is handled in Sweden, where tail docking is banned through national legislation. The study emphasises straw usage and its association with tail biting pigs and problems in the manure handling system. The expectation is that this information could be conveyed to the rest of the EU to reduce the need for tail docking. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In a telephone survey of randomly selected Swedish pig farmers (46 nursery and 43 finishing pig units) with at least 50 sows or 300 finishing places, it was found that straw was used by 98% of the farmers. The median daily straw ration provided was 29 g/pig for nursery and 50 g/pig for finishing pigs in systems with partly slatted flooring. The reported prevalence of tail biting was 1.6% at slaughter. The majority of farmers reported that they never had manure handling problems caused by straw (56% of nursery units and 81% of finishing pig units). A proportion of farmers (37%) also provided with additional material apart from straw on some occasions, which may have affected tail biting prevalence and manure handling problems. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Swedish farmers rear undocked pigs without large problems with tail biting. Straw is the main manipulable material used, and additional manipulable material is used to various extents. The low incidence of straw obstructing the manure handling systems implies that it is indeed possible to use straw in partly slatted flooring systems, reducing the need for tail docking. The impact of using additional manipulable material is unknown and requires more investigation to separate the impact of such material from the impact of straw. </AbstractText>

Effectiveness data were taken from UKCTOCS, which considered strategies of multimodal screening (MMS), ultrasound screening (USS) and no screening. We conducted systematic reviews to identify the remaining model inputs, and performed a rigorous and transparent prospective evaluation of different methods for extrapolating the effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality. We considered costs to the UK healthcare system and measured effectiveness using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We used value of information methods to estimate the value of further research. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Over a lifetime, MMS and USS were estimated to be both more expensive and more effective than no screening.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing MMS with no screening was £8864 per QALY (£2600 to £51,576). Alternative extrapolation methods increased the ICER, with the highest value being £36,769 (£13,888 to dominated by no screening). Using the UKCTOCS trial horizon, both MMS and USS were dominated by no screening, as they produced fewer QALYs at a greater cost. The value of research into eliminating all uncertainty in long-term effectiveness was estimated to be worth up to £20 million, or approximately £5 million for four years follow-up. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Screening for ovarian cancer with MMS is both more effective and more expensive than not screening.

In addition to its beneficial effects on withdrawal and prevention of relapse, reports of sedation during clinical treatment suggest that arousal networks in the brain may be recruited during Heantos administration. T-type calcium channels are implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms and in this study we examined whether a Heantos-4 extraction modulates T-type calcium channel currents generated by the Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Ca3.3 subtypes. Utilizing whole-cell voltage clamp on exogenously expressed T-type calcium channels we find that Heantos inhibits Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 currents, while selectively potentiating Cav3.2 currents. We further examined the effects of Heantos-4 extract on low-threshold burst-firing in thalamic neurons which contribute to sleep oscillations. Using whole-cell current clamp in acute thalamic brain slices Heantos-4 suppressed rebound burst-firing in ventrobasal thalamocortical neurons, which express primarily Cav3.1 channels. Conversely, Heantos-4 had no significant effect on the burst-firing properties of thalamic reticular neurons, which express a mixed population of Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 channels. Examining Heantos-4 effects following oral administration in a model of absence epilepsy revealed the potential to exacerbate seizure activity. Together, the findings indicate that Heantos-4 has selective effects both on specific T-type calcium channel isoforms and distinct populations of thalamic neurons providing a putative mechanism underlying its effects on sedation and on the thalamocortical network. </AbstractText>

To describe resistance in Salmonella that caused foodborne outbreaks in the United States, we linked outbreaks submitted to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System to isolate susceptibility data in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. Resistant outbreaks were defined as those linked to one or more isolates with resistance to at least one antimicrobial drug. Multidrug resistant (MDR) outbreaks had at least one isolate resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes. Twenty-one per cent (37/176) of linked outbreaks were resistant. In outbreaks attributed to a single food group, 73% (16/22) of resistant outbreaks and 46% (31/68) of non-resistant outbreaks were attributed to foods from land animals (P < 0·05). MDR Salmonella with clinically important resistance caused 29% (14/48) of outbreaks from land animals and 8% (3/40) of outbreaks from plant products (P < 0·01). In our study, resistant Salmonella infections were more common in outbreaks attributed to foods from land animals than outbreaks from foods from plants or aquatic animals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on isolates from foodborne Salmonella outbreaks can help determine which foods are associated with resistant infections. </AbstractText>

The genotype changed several times, from genotype I to IV in 2002, from IV to I in 2005, and from I to V in 2014. These genotype shifts may be the cause of DENV outbreaks. The diversity of genotypes and clades demonstrates a high risk of future outbreaks in Guangzhou.

Perceived stigma's contribution to suicidal ideation was fully mediated by anticipated discrimination, but not by self-stigma. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In general, programmes addressing multiple stigma components seem to be most effective in improving suicide prevention. Besides interventions targeting negative attitudes and discriminating behaviours of the general public, programmes to support persons with mental illness in coping with perceived and experienced stigma could improve suicide prevention. Future studies should test the short- and long-term effects of such interventions on suicidality and further investigate the role of stigma coping (e.g. secrecy) and emotional consequences (e.g. hopelessness and loneliness) for the association between stigma components and suicidality. </AbstractText>

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of green tea extract (GTE) intake during lactation on macrophage infiltration, and activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and serine-threonine kinase Akt (Akt) in the hearts of weanlings exposed to maternal dietary protein restriction. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed control (C) or low-protein diets (LP) throughout gestation. Following delivery, the dams received a control or a GTE-containing control diet during lactation: control diet during gestation and lactation (CC), low-protein diet during gestation and lactation (LPC), low-protein diet during gestation and 0.12% GTE-containing low-protein diet during lactation (LPL), and low-protein diet during gestation and 0.24% GTE-containing low-protein diet during lactation (LPH). The female offspring were sacrificed at day 22. Biochemical parameters in the plasma, macrophage infiltration, degree of fibrosis and expression levels of AMPK and Akt were examined. The plasma insulin level increased in LPH compared with LPC. Percentage of the fibrotic areas and the number of macrophages in LPC were higher than those in CC. Conversely, the fibrotic areas and the macrophage number in LPH were smaller (21 and 56%, respectively) than those in LPC. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK in LPL and LPH, and Akt in LPH were greater than those in LPC. In conclusion, maternal protein restriction may induce macrophage infiltration and the decrease of insulin levels. However, GTE intake during lactation may suppress macrophage infiltration and restore insulin secretion function via upregulation of AMPK and insulin signaling in weanlings. </AbstractText>

27919305|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon that arises when the expression of genes depends on the parental origin of alleles. Epigenetic mechanisms may induce the full or partial suppression of maternal or paternal alleles, thereby leading to different types of imprinting. However, imprinting effects have received little consideration in animal breeding programmes, although their relevance to some agricultural important traits has been demonstrated. A recently proposed model (imprinting model) with two path-of-transmission (male and female)-specific breeding values for each animal accounts for all types of imprinting simultaneously (paternal, maternal, full and partial). Imprinting effects (or more generally: parent-of-origin effects (POE)) are determined by taking the difference between the two genetic effects in each animal. However, the computation of their prediction error variance (PEV) is laborious; thus, we propose a new model that is equivalent to the aforementioned imprinting model, which facilitates the direct estimation of imprinting effects instead of taking the differences and the PEV is readily obtained. We applied the new model to slaughterhouse data for Brown Swiss cattle, among which imprinting has never been investigated previously. Data were available for up to 173 051 fattening bulls, where the pedigrees contained up to 428 710 animals representing the entire Brown Swiss population of Austria and Germany. The traits analysed comprised the net BW gain, fat score, EUROP class and killing out percentage. The analysis demonstrated that the net BW gain, fat score and EUROP class were influenced significantly by POE. After estimating the POE, the new model yielded estimates with reliabilities ranging between 0.4 and 0.9. On average, the imprinting variances accounted for 9.6% of the total genetic variance, where the maternal gamete was the main contributor. Moreover, our results agreed well with those obtained using linear models when the EUROP class and fat score were treated as categorical traits by applying a GLMM with a logit link function. </AbstractText>

Our objectives were, first, to examine the importance of peace in palliative care as a measure of acceptance and in chronic illness settings as a predictor of improved survival. Second, we explored the dimensions of peace and their relationships with spiritual well-being. We further examined how the constructs of peace are assessed both within valid spiritual well-being measures and as individual items related solely to peace. Finally, we examined therapies aimed at promoting peace and emotional well-being in palliative and chronic illness settings. Despite much being written about different constructs of peace and the positive effects of being at peace during times of illness, the effects of therapies on the feeling of peace are not well-studied. </AbstractText>

DESIGN Epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak. SETTING Oncology clinic (clinic A). METHODS Cases were defined as Pantoea isolation from blood or catheter tip cultures of clinic A patients during July 2012-May 2013. Clinic A medical charts and laboratory records were reviewed; infection prevention practices and the facility's water system were evaluated. Environmental samples were collected for culture. Clinical and environmental P. agglomerans isolates were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS Twelve cases were identified; median (range) age was 65 (41-78) years. All patients had malignant tumors and had received infusions at clinic A. Deficiencies in parenteral medication preparation and handling were identified (eg, placing infusates near sinks with potential for splash-back contamination). Facility inspection revealed substantial dead-end water piping and inadequate chlorine residual in tap water from multiple sinks, including the pharmacy clean room sink. P. agglomerans was isolated from composite surface swabs of 7 sinks and an ice machine; the pharmacy clean room sink isolate was indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis from 7 of 9 available patient isolates. CONCLUSIONS Exposure of locally prepared infusates to a contaminated pharmacy sink caused the outbreak. Improvements in parenteral medication preparation, including moving chemotherapy preparation offsite, along with terminal sink cleaning and water system remediation ended the outbreak. Greater awareness of recommended medication preparation and handling practices as well as further efforts to better define the contribution of contaminated sinks and plumbing deficiencies to healthcare-associated infections are needed.

Previous results are inconsistent, and indicate possible variation by sex. Adult liver enzymes [?-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartase transaminase (AST)] were measured in two cohort studies: the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS; n=1803) and the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns (YF; n=3571) study, which also had ultrasound measures of liver fat (n=2546). Predictors of dichotomized (clinical cut-offs) and continuous (within the reference range) liver enzymes included low birthweight (4000 g), small-for-gestational-age (birthweight 90th percentile), and preterm birth. Multiple logistic and linear regression were conducted, adjusted for medical, behavioral and socioeconomic indicators. Interactions with sex were also examined. In BHS, birth measures were not strongly associated with clinically high levels of liver enzymes, and within the reference range measures of reduced growth were associated with increased AST in women. In the YF study, at least one marker of reduced growth was associated with higher GGT, higher ALT and higher AST (in women). Probable fatty liver on ultrasound was associated with low birthweight (2.41, 1.42-4.09) and preterm birth (2.84, 1.70-4.76). These results suggest a link between birth parameters and adult fatty liver, but encourage consideration of population variation in these relationships. </AbstractText>

The problem is that focus has been on schools and teachers and not students. Here is a simple thought experiment with two conditions: 1) 50 teachers are assigned by their teaching quality to randomly composed classes of 20 students, 2) 50 classes of 20 each are composed by selecting the most able students to fill each class in order and teachers are assigned randomly to classes. In condition 1, teaching ability of each teacher and in condition 2, mean ability level of students in each class is correlated with average gain over the course of instruction. Educational gain will be best predicted by student abilities (up to r = 0.95) and much less by teachers' skill (up to r = 0.32). I argue that seemingly immutable education will not change until we fully understand students and particularly human intelligence. Over the last 50 years in developed countries, evidence has accumulated that only about 10% of school achievement can be attributed to schools and teachers while the remaining 90% is due to characteristics associated with students. Teachers account for from 1% to 7% of total variance at every level of education. For students, intelligence accounts for much of the 90% of variance associated with learning gains.

DESIGN AND SETTING Epidemiologic investigation of an LD outbreak among patients and a visitor exposed to a newly constructed hematology-oncology unit. METHODS An LD case was defined as radiographically confirmed pneumonia in a person with positive urinary antigen testing and/or respiratory culture for Legionella and exposure to the hematology-oncology unit after February 20, 2014. Cases were classified as definitely or probably healthcare-associated based on whether they were exposed to the unit for all or part of the incubation period (2-10 days). We conducted an environmental assessment and collected water samples for culture. Clinical and environmental isolates were compared by monoclonal antibody (MAb) and sequence-based typing. RESULTS Over a 12-week period, 10 cases were identified, including 6 definite and 4 probable cases. Environmental sampling revealed Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) in the potable water at 9 of 10 unit sites (90%), including all patient rooms tested. The 3 clinical isolates were identical to environmental isolates from the unit (MAb2-positive, sequence type ST36). No cases occurred with exposure after the implementation of water restrictions followed by point-of-use filters. CONCLUSIONS Contamination of the unit's potable water system with Lp1 strain ST36 was the likely source of this outbreak. Healthcare providers should routinely test patients who develop pneumonia at least 2 days after hospital admission for LD. A single case of LD that is definitely healthcare associated should prompt a full investigation. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016:1-8. </AbstractText>

Predicting RPH population dynamics and identifying their source areas are crucial for the management of these migratory pests in China, but the origins of the migrants to temperate and subtropical regions in China remains unclear. In particular, their early migration to China in March and April have not yet been explored due to a lack of research data available from potential source areas, Central Vietnam and Laos. In this study, we examined the population dynamics and migratory paths of N. lugens and S. furcifera in Vietnam and South China in 2012 and 2013. Trajectory modeling showed that in March and April in 2012 and 2013, RPH emigrated from source areas in Central Vietnam where rice was maturing to the Red River Delta and South China. Early migrants originated from Southern Central Vietnam (14-16°N), but later most were from Northern Central Vietnam (16-19°N). Analysis of meteorological and light-trap data from Hepu in April (1977-2013) using generalized linear models showed that immigration increased with precipitation in Southern Central Vietnam in January, but declined with precipitation in Northern Central Vietnam in January. These results determined that the RPH originate from overwintering areas in Central Vietnam, but not from southernmost areas of Vietnam. Winter precipitation, rather than temperature was the most important factor determining the number of RPH migrants. Based on their similar population dynamics and low population densities in Central Vietnam, we further speculated that RPH migrate to track ephemeral food resources whilst simultaneously avoiding predators. Migrations do not seem to be initiated by interspecific competition, overcrowding or host deterioration. Nevertheless, S. furcifera establishes populations earlier than N. lugens South China, perhaps to compensate for interspecific competition. We provide new information that could assist with forecasting outbreaks and implementing control measures against these migratory pests. </AbstractText>

Current evidence supporting this view move from theoretical models correlating intelligence and individual response to systematic "lesions" of brain connectivity, as well as from the field of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NiBS). Perturbation-based approaches based on techniques as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), are opening new in vivo scenarios which could allow to disclose more causal relationship between intelligence and brain plasticity, overcoming the limitations of brain-behavior correlational evidence. </AbstractText>

Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in Drosophila expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans. </AbstractText>

Since consolidation occurs during sleep, even fleeting experiences when animals are awakened may produce maladaptive long-term memory, or may interrupt consolidation. In a learning paradigm affecting Aplysia feeding, when animals were trained after being awakened from sleep, interactions between new experiences and consolidation were prevented by blocking long-term memory arising from the new experiences. Inhibiting protein synthesis eliminated the block and allowed even a brief, generally ineffective training to produce long-term memory. Memory formation depended on consolidative proteins already expressed before training. After effective training, long term memory required subsequent transcription and translation. Memory formation during the sleep phase was correlated with increased CREB1 transcription, but not CREB2 transcription. Increased C/EBP transcription was a correlate of both effective and ineffective training and of treatments not producing memory. </AbstractText>

However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25-48 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption.

However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress. </AbstractText>

Radiation-induced late effects may manifest as brain tumors or cognitive impairment. Decreased neurogenesis and differentiation, alteration in neural structure and synaptic plasticity as well as increased oxidative stress and inflammation are suggested to contribute to adverse effects in the brain. In addition to neural stems cells, several brain-specific mature cell types including endothelial and glial cells are negatively affected by ionizing radiation. Radiation-induced enhancement of endothelial cell apoptosis results in disruption of the vascular system and the blood brain barrier. Activated microglia create inflammatory environment that negatively affects neuronal structures and results in decreased synaptic plasticity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in radiation-induced brain injury remain elusive, first strategies for prevention and amelioration are being developed. Drug-based prevention and treatment focus mainly on the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. Cell replacement therapy holds great promise as first animal studies using transplantation of neural stem cells to irradiated brain have been successful in restoring memory and cognition deficits. This review summarizes the epidemiological and biological data on radiation-induced brain damage and describes prevention and therapy methods to avoid and ameliorate these adverse effects, respectively. </AbstractText>

The few studies available provide only limited support for the ICRP assumption that radiation-related minor opacities are predictive of vision-impairing cataracts; further longitudinal data are clearly needed. In keeping with the ICRP assumption, there is currently no compelling evidence for diminished cataractogenic effects at low dose rates, i.e., the data are compatible with a dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) of unity but the uncertainties are large enough that other values of DREF cannot be ruled out. Most available epidemiologic data suggest there is a dose threshold somewhere between several hundred mGy and one Gy for lens opacities. The new studies of medical and occupational exposures that have evaluated groups with low doses tend to confirm there is little or no excess risk at doses under 100mGy, while new studies of interventional cardiologist personnel who often have substantial doses to the lens of the eye have shown elevated opacity risks. Thus occupations that have high lens doses should receive remedial attention to prevent lens opacity risk. </AbstractText>

The 2012 recommendation of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to substantially reduce the annual occupational equivalent dose limit for the ocular lens has now been adopted in the European Union and is under consideration around the rest of the world. However, ICRP clearly states that the recommendations are chiefly based on epidemiological evidence because there are a very small number of studies that provide explicit biological, mechanistic evidence at doses <2Gy. This paper aims to present a review of recently published information on the biological and mechanistic aspects of cataracts induced by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). The data were compiled by assessing the pertinent literature in several distinct areas which contribute to the understanding of IR induced cataracts, information regarding lens biology and general processes of cataractogenesis. Results from cellular and tissue level studies and animal models, and relevant human studies, were examined. The main focus was the biological effects of low linear energy transfer IR, but dosimetry issues and a number of other confounding factors were also considered. The results of this review clearly highlight a number of gaps in current knowledge. Overall, while there have been a number of recent advances in understanding, it remains unknown exactly how IR exposure contributes to opacification. A fuller understanding of how exposure to relatively low doses of IR promotes induction and/or progression of IR-induced cataracts will have important implications for prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as for the field of radiation protection. </AbstractText>

27919335|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Biological effectiveness of ionizing radiation differs with its linear energy transfer (LET) such that high-LET radiation is more effective for various biological endpoints than low-LET radiation. Human exposure to high-LET radiation occurs in cancer patients, nuclear workers, aviators, astronauts and other space travellers. From the radiation protection viewpoint, the ocular lens is among the most radiosensitive tissues in the body, and cataract (a clouding of the normally transparent lens) is classified as tissue reactions (formerly called nonstochastic or deterministic effects) with a threshold below which no effect would occur. To prevent radiation cataracts, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has recommended an equivalent dose limit for the lens according to the threshold for vision-impairing cataracts. ICRP recommended the threshold of >8Gy in 1984 and an occupational dose limit of 150mSv/year in 1980. These remained unchanged until 2011, when ICRP recommended lowering the threshold to 0.5Gy and the dose limit to 20mSv/year (averaged over 5 years with no single year exceeding 50mSv). Although such reduction of the threshold was based on findings from low-LET radiation, the dose limit was recommended in Sv. Historically, the lens is the exceptional tissue for which ICRP had assigned a special factor in addition to a general radiation weighting factor, predicated on a belief that the lens is more vulnerable to high-LET radiation than other tissues. Considering such radiosensitive nature of the lens, a deeper understanding of a cataractogenic potential of high-LET radiation is indispensable. This review is thus designed to provide an update on the current knowledge as to high-LET radiation cataractogenesis. To this end, changes in ICRP recommendations on lenticular radiation protection, epidemiological and biological findings on high-LET cataractogenesis are reviewed, and future research needs are then discussed. </AbstractText>

Oral mucositis is the most frequent, often dose-limiting early adverse event of radio(chemo)therapy for HNT. The oral mucosal response is - like that of typical turnover tissues - based on radiation-induced impairment of epithelial proliferation and cell production, in face of ongoing physiological cell differentiation and cell loss, consequently resulting in hypoplasia and eventually mucosal ulceration. The regenerative epithelial response, i.e. repopulation, and hence the impact of overall treatment time, besides intrinsic radiosensitivity, is the dominant parameter of the radiation tolerance of oral mucosa in fractionated radiotherapy protocols. The epithelial changes are accompanied, at the molecular and cellular level, by various changes in non-epithelial cell populations, i.e. vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. An inflammatory response precedes and parallels the epithelial changes; this includes vasodilation associated with rheological consequences and the manifestation of local hypoxia, activation of macrophages and endothelial cells. During these processes, a variety of intra- and intercellular communication pathways are modulated; NF-?B associated signaling is one prominent example. The interactions of these extra-epithelial changes with epithelial hypoplasia, ulceration and regeneration currently remain largely unclear. Research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestation of oral mucositis will allow for identification of potential early biomarkers of oral mucosal morbidity and thus for individualization of patient follow-up and treatment, and also for the development of targeted strategies for prophylaxis and/or mitigation of oral mucositis. This review summarizes the features of the clinical manifestation of oral mucositis and its consequences, the "classical" radiobiological parameters of mucosal radiation sensitivity. It moreover focuses on the underlying "molecular" mechanisms, and on biology-based approaches for the amelioration of radiation-induced oral mucositis. </AbstractText>

27919337|a|<AbstractText Label="null" NlmCategory="UNLABELLED">Exposure to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation is associated with damage to the heart and coronary arteries. However, only recently have studies with high-quality individual dosimetry data allowed this risk to be quantified while also adjusting for concomitant chemotherapy, and medical and lifestyle risk factors. At lower levels of exposure the evidence is less clear. In this article I review radiation-associated risks of circulatory disease in groups treated with radiotherapy for malignant and non-malignant disease, and in occupationally- or environmentally-exposed groups receiving rather lower levels of radiation dose, also for medical diagnostic purposes. Results of a meta-analysis suggest that excess relative risks per unit dose for various types of heart disease do not exhibit statistically significant (p>0.2) heterogeneity between studies. Although there are no marked discrepancies between risks derived from the high-dose therapeutic and medical diagnostic studies and from the moderate/low dose occupational and environmental studies, at least for ischemic heart disease and stroke there are indications of larger risks per unit dose for lower dose rate and fractionated exposures. Risks for stroke and other types of circulatory disease are significantly more variable (p<0.0001), possibly resulting from confounding and effect-modification by well known (but unobserved) risk factors. Adjustment for any of mean dose, dose fractionation or age at exposure results in the residual heterogeneity for cerebrovascular disease becoming non-significant. The review provides strong evidence in support of a causal association between both low and high dose radiation exposure and most types of circulatory disease. </AbstractText>

Clinical studies have identified early and late manifestations of radiation-induced heart disease, a side effect of radiation therapy to tumors in the chest when all or part of the heart is situated in the radiation field. Studies in preclinical animal models have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms by which radiation may injure the heart. More recent observations in human subjects suggest that ionizing radiation may have cardiovascular effects at lower doses than was previously thought. This has led to examinations of low-dose photons and low-dose charged particle irradiation in animal models. Lastly, studies have started to identify non-invasive methods for detection of cardiac radiation injury and interventions that may prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. Altogether, this ongoing research should increase our knowledge of biological mechanisms of cardiovascular radiation injury, identify non-invasive biomarkers for early detection, and potential interventions that may prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. </AbstractText>

In the steady-state, it is generally considered that the crypt cell lineages in both small and large intestine are maintained by a small number of stem cells, but there are differences for example in the composition of their niche residence and in the numbers of transit cell generations. Various cell surface markers are now available to indentify particular lineage cell types. Radiation doses up to 1Gy cause apoptotic stem-cell death in particular locations, at higher doses to >6Gy Lgr5(+) stem cells are required for normal intestinal recovery, and at >8Gy some crypts are sterilised and the probability of animal death from intestinal injury increases with higher doses. Mutations in repair genes, tumour suppressor genes, and survival genes cause various degrees of stem cell and clonogenic cell radiosensitisation. Recent evidence is suggesting much plasticity in the crypt cell lineage, potentially contributing to flexibility in the hierarchical lineage, clonogen number variations and the sensitisation differences. Knockout mice for many different genes have been used to detect their role in both steady state and in irradiated conditions, expected to lead to further insight to the damage and restorative processes. Many different external agents have been used to ameliorate intestinal reactions, including prostaglandins, interleukins, angiogenic and epithelial growth factors, other cytokines, and intraluminal factors. </AbstractText>

In differentiating spermatogenic cells, the genomic instability is limited in time, whereas in spermatogonial stem cells it can be maintained all along life. Spermatogonial stem cells are long-lived cells that support normal germ cell differentiation and must be preserved throughout life. However after irradiation spermatogenesis recovery can be impaired as a consequence of the radiation-induced decline in spermatogonial stem cell. In this review, we summarize the differential sensitivities to DNA damage of spermatogenic cell populations, and the DNA repair mechanisms activated in these cells that paradoxically might favour the maintenance of cells with impaired genomic integrity. We describe how the testis tissue collapses in response to irradiation and we discuss the molecular pathways involved in the control of DNA damage response and homeostasis in spermatogonial stem cells. </AbstractText>

Skin is a radio-responsive tissue, developing all types of radiation damage and pathologies, including early tissue reactions such as dysplasia and denudation in epidermis, and later fibrosis in the dermis and acanthosis in epidermis, with the TGF-beta 1 pathway as a known master switch. Also there is a risk of basal cell carcinoma, which arises from epidermal keratinocytes, notably after oncogenic events in PTCH1 or TP53 genes. This review will cover the mechanisms of adverse human skin reactions and carcinogenesis after various types of exposures to ionizing radiation, with comparison with animal data when necessary, and will discuss the possible role of stem cells and their progeny in the development of these disorders. The main endpoints presented are basal cell intrinsic radiosensitivity, genomic stability, individual factors of risk, dose specific responses, major molecular pathways involved and the cellular origin of skin reactions and cancer. Although major advances have been obtained in recent years, the precise implications of epidermal stem cells and their progeny in these processes are not yet fully characterized. </AbstractText>

The first evidence of the individual response to IR was reported in the beginning of the 20th century. Considering nearly one century of observations, we here propose three aspects of individual IR response: radiosensitivity for early or late adverse tissue events after radiotherapy on normal tissues (non-cancer effects attributable to cell death); radiosusceptibility for IR-induced cancers; and radiodegeneration for non-cancer effects that are often attributable to mechanisms other than cell death (e.g., cataracts and circulatory disease). All the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind IR-induced individual effects are not fully elucidated. However, some specific assays may help their quantification according to the dose and to the genetic status. Accumulated data on individual factors have suggested that the individual IR response cannot be ignored and raises some clinical and societal issues. The individual IR response therefore needs to be taken into account to better evaluate the risks related to IR exposure. </AbstractText>

Initially, the FDA authority was restricted to issues of safety and only later did the documentation of efficacy become part of the review process required for approval. However, all drugs have the potential for causing harm at some dose level to all and at lower doses in certain patients with vulnerability to the particular pharmacology of the agent. As new drugs have been designed to manage disorders that are uncommon, but of significant consequence, they may have adverse effects that are acceptable only because they are so uniquely beneficial to these specific conditions. The risk of these adverse effects may be acceptable since the benefit can outweigh the harm in most patients and the adversity can be predicted and managed. The approval of this category of drugs has grown rapidly since definition of a mechanism of action to manage and modify the risk has been provided by a process known as known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or "REMS." In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) allowed the FDA to require postmarketing studies and the authority to mandate the implementation of a REMS for drugs with efficacy but documented potential for harm. Two relatively new drugs useful in the management of severe elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been approved under a requirement for a REMS. These are lomitapide, an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide which reduces the synthesis of apolipoprotein B. </AbstractText>

Population studies suggest that approximately 0.1% of Northern Europeans and US Caucasians carries the R3500Q variant in APOB most commonly associated with FDB; in addition, the APOB R3500 W variant is known to make a significant contribution to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) among East Asians.

Baseline LDL-cholesterol averaged 4.1 mmol/L (159 mg/dL; SD = 1.0) and HDL-C 1.6 mmol/L (62 mg/dL; SD = 0.5). LDL-C decreased in the first 12 months in ezetimibe-LLT (lipid-lowering therapy) initiators, switchers (monotherapy), and combination therapy with a statin by respectively 21.3%, 6.4%, and 29.1%. The corresponding predicted rate reductions of CV events (non-fatal and fatal) compared to no treatment or to a statin (combination therapy) were respectively 8, 2, and 12 per 1000 patients treated over 5 years, with a global NNT of 143 patients over 5 years. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These results, accounting for observed CV event rates, risk factors evolution over time and adherence to treatment in real life, were consistent with those from clinical trials. </AbstractText>

We assessed whether this is an accurate surrogate measurement of Lp(a) mass. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">VAP-Lp(a)-C and VAP-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) estimated by the VAP technique, Lp(a) mass, oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) that primarily reflect OxPL on Lp(a), and HDL-C measured by enzymatic methods were measured in 552 hypercholesterolemic patients at baseline and 24 weeks after therapy with niacin monotherapy (N = 118), ezetimibe/simvastatin monotherapy (n = 155), or ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) + niacin (to 2 g) (N = 279) in a randomized, double-blind trial. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated only modestly with Lp(a) mass at baseline (r = 0.56, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.56, P < .001), explaining only 31% of the association. VAP-Lp(a)-C correlated with HDL-C at baseline (r = 0.34, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.30, P < .001) and with VAP-HDL-C at baseline (r = 39, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.33, P < .001). In contrast, Lp(a) mass did not correlate with HDL-C at baseline (r = 0.06, P = .12) and 24 weeks (r = -0.01 P = .91). Lp(a) mass correlated strongly with oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 at baseline (r = 0.81, P < .001) and 24 weeks (r = 0.79, P < .001). VAP-Lp(a)-C levels increased linearly with HDL-C and VAP-HDL-C quartiles (P < .001 for both) but Lp(a) mass did not. Quantitating the percent of cholesterol present on Lp(a) by dividing VAP-Lp(a)-C by Lp(a) mass revealed that 25% of patients had a percentage >100, which is not possible. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">VAP-Lp(a)-C is a poor estimate for Lp(a) mass and likely reflects the content of HDL-C in the overlapping density spectrum of Lp(a) and HDL. These data suggest that patients with prior VAP-Lp(a)-C measurements may have misclassification of Lp(a)-related risk. </AbstractText>

Whether in them the high cholesterol trait is transmitted monogenically has not been studied. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVES" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">We assessed the inheritance pattern, penetrance, and expression of high low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDLc) in families with genetic hypercholesterolemia (GH) without known causative mutations (non-FH-GH). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The study included probands with a clinical diagnosis of FH and their families attending 2 lipid clinics in Spain. Inclusion criteria for probands were LDLc >95th percentile, triglycerides <90th percentile, at least 1 first-degree family member with LDLc >90th percentile, >5 points in the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria score, and absence of mutations in LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 or APOE. Eleven FH families with a LDLR mutation were also examined for comparison. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We analyzed 49 non-FH-GH probands and 277 first-and second-degree relatives. LDLc was >90th percentile in 37.8% of blood relatives, at concentrations similar to those of probands. LDLc had a normal distribution in non-FH-GH families, in contrast with a bimodal distribution in FH families. When a dominant model was tested, family-based association tests gave much lower heritability values for total cholesterol and LDLc in non-FH-GH (0.39 and 0.32, respectively) than in FH (0.78 and 0.61, respectively). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Non-FH-GH families have a milder lipid phenotype than genetically defined FH. The heritage pattern of LDLc in non-FH-GH does not fit with a monogenic disorder. Our findings support the concept that most non-FH-GHs are polygenic hypercholesterolemias. </AbstractText>

We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with (1) statin initiation (any history of statin therapy) and (2) statin persistence (active statin prescription at the study end). </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of 8488 study patients, 7427 (87.5%) ever received statins and 6212 (73.2%) had persistent statin therapy. Younger age (odds ratio [OR], 1.26 per decade), smoking (OR, 1.49) and cardiologist evaluation (OR, 2.26) were associated with statin initiation (P < .0001 for all). Younger age (OR, 1.17), family history of CAD (OR, 1.39), no adverse reactions to statins (OR, 1.40; P < .0001 for all), female sex (OR, 1.22; P = .005), history of smoking (OR, 1.22; P = .003), cardiologist evaluation (OR, 1.23; P = .002), and lower HbA1c (OR, 1.04; P = 0.003) were associated with persistent statin therapy. Only 362 (29.8%) of the 1215 patients without persistent statin therapy had tried at least 2 statins, and 58 (4.8%) tried 3 statins. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Many patients with combined CAD and diabetes are not treated with statins, although in this very high-risk group, even moderate-intensity statins result in meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events. Higher cardiovascular risk and cardiologist evaluation were associated with higher prevalence of statin therapy. </AbstractText>

Hazard ratio (HR) of incident high TG/HDL-C was adjusted for age and waist girth. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Men with low CRF had the highest prevalence of a high TG/HDL-C ratio. In the population with normal TG/HDL-C, age-adjusted HR of incident high TG/HDL-C ratio was 2.77 times higher in men with lowest CRF than in those with highest CRF. Incidence of conversion of normal to high ratio was 5.5% per year in low CRF population, compared with 1.7% in high CRF subjects. Incidence HR was independent of waist girth. Men who converted from normal to high TG/HDL-C ratio during the follow-up period had increased number of metabolic risk factors and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Men who did not convert to a high TG/HDL-C ratio retained a low prevalence of metabolic syndrome risk factors. </AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">A high TG/HDL-C ratio is common in men with low CRF. Metabolic syndrome also is common among those with a high ratio. </AbstractText>
